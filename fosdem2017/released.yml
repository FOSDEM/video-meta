    Containerised Application technologies like AppImage, Snappy and Flatpakpromise a brave new world for Linux applications, free from the worries ofshared libraries and dependency issues. Just one problem, this is a road longtravelled before, such as in the application dark ages of Win32 applicationsand DLLs. And it worked out so wonderfully there... Do we risk a future where,like the resurrected dinosaurs of Jurassic Park, this family of applicationswill break their containment and start eating our users? This session will tryto present a balanced argument about the situation, frankly discussing thebenefits promised by these technologies, but highlighting the very real issuesand risks their widespread adoption could, and in some cases are, alreadybringing to the table.

    The talk with cover the promised benefits of application containers, such asAppImage, Snappy and Flatpak. It will detail the empowerment of developers whouse the technologies, the ability for upstream projects to have a much closerrole in delivering their software, and the benefits that brings to both theupstream projects and their users. But as a counter to those benefits, thesession will detail some of the risks and responsibilities that come with thattechnology. The complexities of library integration, the risk of introducingnew forms of dependency issues, and the transference of responsibility forthose issues, plus security, away from the current Distributions deliveringupstream projects towards those upstream projects directly. As a conclusion,the session will present some suggestions to upstream projects adopting thesetechnologies to start them down the road of accepting those responsibilitiesdirectly, or working more closely with existing Distribution projects to sharethe burdens these technologies now provide.

    After 25 years of copyleft enforcement and compliance work, is copyleftsucceeding as a strategy to defend software freedom? This talk explores thehistory of enforcement of the GPL and other copyleft licenses, and considersthis question carefully. Attendees who have hitherto not followed the currentand past debates about copyleft licenses and their enforcement can attend thistalk and learn the background, and can expect to learn enough to providesalient and informed feedback of their own opinions about the processes behindupholding copyleft.

    The [first GPL enforcement action was done by Richard Stallman against NeXTComputers in 1989](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.en.html),regarding Objective C support in GCC. For 25 years, GPL enforcement hasremained a regular but rarely mainstream activity in Open Source and FreeSoftware projects. Very few projects enforce their[copyleft](https://copyleft.org/) licenses; most live with regular violationsand merely ignore them, or simply beg violators to comply.

    Even under the now-published and publicly discussed [Community Principles ofGPL Enforcement](https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html), co-drafted by Software Freedom Conservancy andthe Free Software Foundation, GPL enforcement is regularly criticized andquestioned. Those of us who enforce the GPL get wildly inconsistent feedbackfrom the community: some copyright holders recruit organizations likeConservancy and FSF to enforce as much as possible, others often complainingthat we simply don't enforce enough, and still others call for a completemoratorium on GPL enforcement.

    Meanwhile, not all enforcement abides by community principles. For-profitenforcers, who have existed for decades, use copyleft licenses in a manner notintended by the license drafters: to captiously convince "customers" that theymust buy proprietary licenses, or otherwise pay, to incorporate Open Sourceand Free Software into their products.

    This complex landscape has become almost impenetrable for the average FLOSSdevelopers who merely wish their code to remain forever free and libre. Thistalk will provide the basic history and background information about the stateof copyleft in our community, and set the stage for all developers to giveinformed feedback to organizations that stand up for copyleft.

    One of the fundamental problems with UNIX-like operating systems is that theydon't seem to make it easy and intuitive to develop applications that arestrongly hardened against exploits through sandboxing. With CloudABI, we'retrying to make this process a lot easier.

    CloudABI is a blend of POSIX and pure capability-based security, which allowsyou to create applications that are only capable of accessing those thingsthat they are designed to use. As you'll see, software also becomes easier totest and deploy as a result of using this model.

    In this presentation I am going to discuss a project I've been working on overthe last two years, called CloudABI. CloudABI is a simplified POSIX-likeruntime environment that is inspired by FreeBSD's Capsicum. It allows you tocreate programs that can solely interact with the environment through filedescriptors (capabilities). Compared to traditional UNIX-like systems, thisapproach has three advantages:

      1. It reduces the impact of exploits. If an attacker manages to take over control of a CloudABI application, it can only access those resources that the application was designed to use (for a networked service: typically an already bound TCP socket and some data directories). This is different from most traditional UNIX-like systems, where an attacker would gain access to all resources that the user running the application can access, which is very broad.

      2. It makes applications easier to test. By knowing that an application can only access those resources that are provided explicitly, the entire environment in which the application runs can be customized for testing.

      3. Similarly, it makes applications easier to deploy. This model tends to reduce the need for using containers and virtual machines. Applications can be started directly, while still providing the necessary isolation from the rest of the system.

    In this talk I'm going to explain how CloudABI works in detail, while alsodiscussing some of its design decisions. I'll also show how you can designyour own CloudABI programs.

    CloudABI is available for Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. A NetBSD port alsoexists.

    Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) constitutes the bulk of the SoftwareCommons, and is at the heart of our digital society. We discuss why and howthe Software Heritage project is taking over the mission of ensuring that thisprecious body of knowledge will be preserved over time and made available toall.

    The Software Commons is the vast body of human knowledge embedded in softwaresource code, that is publicly available and can be freely altered and reused.Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) constitutes the bulk of it. Sadly we seemto be at increasing risk of losing this precious heritage built by the FOSScommunity over the paste decades: code hosting sites shut down when theirpopularity decreases, tapes of ancient versions of our toolchain (bit-)rot inbasements, etc.

    The ambitious goal of the [SoftwareHeritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) project is to contribute toaddress this risk, by collecting, preserving, and sharing _all_ publiclyavailable software in source code form. Together with its complete VCSdevelopment history. Forever, of course.

    By doing so Software Heritage will serve the needs of: Society, by preservingour collective technological heritage; Industry, by building the largestsoftware provenance open database; Science, by assembling the largest curatedarchive for software research; and Education, by creating the ultimateanthology for programming curricula.

    Although still in Beta, Software Heritage has already archived more than 3billion unique source code files and 700 million unique commits, spanning morethan 45 million FOSS projects from major software development hubs, GNU/Linuxdistributions, and upstream software collections.

    Software Heritage is developed transparently as a collaborative project andall its own source code is available as FOSS under copyleft licenses.Currently incubated by [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en), the project willgraduate soon to an independent charitable, nonprofit organization.

    We want the free software movement to keep growing and one facet of successfulmovement building is embracing a multi-generational community. The good newsis that there is no age requirement for using, promoting and contributing tofree software. The bad news is that we aren't always doing a great job offacilitating a diverse, inter-generational movement. We'll take a look at whatwe're currently doing to bring in young people, how we are treating olderpeople in our communities and where there is room for improvement.

    Using examples from other movements and inter-generational communities, we'llidentify tactics that aren't being used to build the free software communityand see what we can collectively port over. We plan to inspire the audience tofind ways to recruit and retain young people, inspire older people toparticipate and maintain an unbroken thread of free software conservatorship.

    When designing technologies, networked systems, and measurements on theInternet, we must be aware of their implications and consequences for thesociety and participants. As engineers, scientists, programmers and otherexperts, we have moral obligations towards our peers, users of technologies wecreate, and the wider communities.

    In this talk I want to talk both about general ethical considerations, andspecific examples of moral dilemmas that come from building the RIPE Atlassystem, and conducting measurements that reveal workings of Internetinfrastructure and services.

    RIPE Atlas is an extensive measurement network, where the vantage points(sources of measurements) are hosted by volunteers: mostly individuals athome, but also some institutions (ISPs, IXPs, academia, various otherbusinesses). RIPE Atlas users are using someone else's Internet connection todo measurements. In order to recognise ethical considerations surrounding useof RIPE Atlas, we looked both into the historical considerations of engineersand scientists, and into practical constraints users should keep in mind, andwe published some findings in this article:https://labs.ripe.net/Members/kistel/ethics-of-ripe-atlas-measurements

    Kubernetes enables teams to focus on developing innovative applications bysimplifying deployment, scaling, and configuration through a simple yetflexible API. The system can support all types of applications: web apps,databases, distributed systems, or even VMs; and can do it on any cloud orbare-metal platform. Our vision is that every organization has access to thisinfrastructure technology, a mission we call #GIFEE: Google Infrastructure ForEveryone.

    But, as Kubernetes’s reach grows, what do real production applications looklike? Where does Kubernetes need to go to continue supporting an ever-widerrange?

    Join Brandon Philips for a look at the status of Kubernetes and at the roadmapfor its future, including automated Kubernetes upgrades, management of complexapplications, integration with cloud providers, and multi-cluster federation.

    Thousands of contributors help building the curl software which runs onseveral billions of devices and are affecting every human in the connectedworld daily. How this came to happen, who contributes and how Daniel at thewheel keeps it all together.

    This is a description of a small project with a major reach. curl and libcurlcan probably be considered corner stones in a world of client-side Internettransfers and in particular HTTP, running on every imaginable operating systemand CPU architecture in use today. Started in the late 90s, the software nowruns in billions of devices and is quite likely one of the most widely usedsoftware components - any category. Daniel takes us through how it started,how it works and why it never gets done.

    I've been working on a new system call ABI and the required runtime supportfor a C variant with spacial memory safety. Along the way I've encounteredlots of interesting bits and pieces required to implement a simple C "Hello,World" program. I found the process fascinating so this talk brings all thatknowledge together in one place.

    The first example in the classic "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan andRitchie is in fact a remarkably complete test of the C programming language.This talk provides a guided tour a slightly more complex program whereprintf() is called with multiple arguments. Along the way from the initialprocesses' call to exec() to the final _exit(), we'll tour the program loadingcode in the kernel and the dynamic linker, the basics of system callimplementation, the implementation of the memory allocator, and of courseprintf(). We'll also touch on localization and a little on threading support.Where appropriate, I'll discuss portions of the system that need changing toaccommodate memory safe versions of C like the version we are developing forour CHERI CPU.

    This talk will assume some knowledge of a language with C-like syntax (C, C++,Java, and PHP should all be fine).

    Servers are hacked. Passwords leaked. Personal information stolen. DNSDDoS'ed. Cloud services are mining and exploiting everything they can gettheir hands on. The core problem; centralised server infrastructure.

    In this talk, we will introduce you to SAFE, a decentralised privacy-firstopen source data storage and communications network enabling anyone to developdecentralised, secure, privacy-concealing apps.

    There is no more denying it; the server-centric infrastructure has failed us:personal information mined, private photos are stolen, passwords leaked,entire infrastructures DDoS'ed – en masse. We are doomed!

    But are we? Actually, as engineers, we know better: a decentralised networkhas the highest reliability. With distributed computing resources that canscale up and down on-demand and aren't bound by physical limitations. Andwe've been building these systems, clusters of databases across data centres,successfully for years – in our server backends. On the public internet,however, we are still using a single point of failure infrastructures: DNS,single endpoint IPs.

    But issues with the existing Internet infrastructure don't stop there:government firewalls can block web services for entire countries, our plaintext communication is heavily surveilled, and companies mine our most personaland private data for their profit. To protect one's privacy, people have toresort to obfuscation protocols like Tor – with significant drawbacks likeslower connectivity and worsened user experience. But even then the data isstill stored, exploited and stolen from the centralised "cloud providers".

    It is time that we bring those concepts of distributed computing,decentralised storage and communication out of the data centres into the realmof the wider internet. Combine that with an obfuscating peer-2-peer routingmechanism, a transparent, self-encrypting public-key-infrastructure andautomatic data retention, and you have covered the basics of what the opensource SAFE Network software provides.

    In this talk, we explore the SAFE Network, the underlying DHT-based routing,and the XOR-namespace and how they are used to successfully concealsconnectivity and even metadata itself by making it infeasible for an attackerto calculate the path data will travel. We will discover what it means tobuild privacy-first Apps on a network where all data is sandboxed per tenantand distributed over multiple machines. Furthermore, by taking a look at theAPIs SAFE provides and going through some example apps, we will learn how tostructure and build fully distributed, privacy-first Apps on SAFE today.

    Finally, we will take a look into the future of SAFE, what apps are indevelopment and how developers could alternatively be paid through the built-in currency based on the app usage rather than the exploitation of personaldata.

    SAFE, Secure Access for Everyone.

    How can Open Source Software and safety critical systems work together? DFSGmbH relies on Linux for its core air traffic control systems. We havesuccessfully managed to standardize a highly reliable, modular operatingsystem and hardware platform at DFS.

    In a brief overview we explain the challenges, technical and non-technicalones, we have faced getting to the modular platforms. What approaches did wetake and why? Which ones did work out in the long end? We will cover a broadrange of aspects ranging from hardware life cycles, application lifecycles,regulations, deployment solutions, user acceptance, cost cutting and testing.

    Since its adoption as the SHA-3 standard, Keccak has grown out of the merehashing functionality. We present a consistent set of cryptographic functions,for fast hashing, pseudo-random bit generation, authentication orauthenticated encryption, that enjoy very competitive safety margin vs speedratios. We highlight the bases for the security of these functions and diveinto their software implementations.

    Beyond the FIPS 202 standard functions derived from Keccak (i.e., SHA-3 hashfunctions and SHAKE{128,256} extendable output functions), we present severalinteresting proposals, consistently based on the same permutation or its roundfunction. Among others:

      * For authenticated encryption, Ketje and Keyak are schemes that were selected for the third round of the [CAESAR competition](http://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar-submissions.html). In particular, Keyak proposes interesting features when protecting a stream of data flowing on a network. It exploits the parallelism in modern processors to achieve a high throughput.  * [KangarooTwelve](http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/770.pdf) is a recently published arbitrary-output-length hash function. We designed it so that the implementation can automatically adapt to the available degree of parallelism. On Intel's Haswell and Skylake architectures, it achieves a speed below 1.5 cycles/byte for long inputs.

    Two key aspects will be covered.

    First, the essential goal of these functions is to remain secure despiteadvances in cryptanalysis. We will explain explain how we base the security ontwo strong pillars: the track record of third-party cryptanalysis and thegeneric security of the underlying construction.

    Second, we will explore the [Keccak CodePackage](https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage) and its two-levelstructure. The high-level cryptographic services are implemented in plain C,without any specific optimizations. The low-level services implement thepermutations and the state input/output functions, for which we provideoptimized code for different platforms. Another interesting topic to discussis how the parallelism is exploited on modern processors with SIMD units.

    This talk covers an alternative to key escrows using new cryptographictechniques implemented by the Clevis (client) and Tang (server) projects.

    Keeping secrets is tough. It is hard enough when you have control over thefull computing chain. But now we are expected to keep secrets while storingthose secrets in cloud and SaaS infrastructures. At least we can trust thenetwork providers, right? Of course, the answer is to encrypt the data. Butthen how do we know who should have access to the data and when? This talkwill look at the new strategies and cryptographic techniques implemented bythe Tang and Clevis open source projects. Tang forgoes complex (andcompromise-prone) key management infrastructures by using simple algorithms tobind data to third party entities. Clevis permits sophisticated unlockingpolicies that go beyond simply password management to true attributedcryptography. Come see how to integrate Tang and Clevis into yourinfrastructure or software project!

    For the last 2 years the Matrix.org team has been working on libolm - a clean-room FOSS liberal-licensed (Apache) independent specification andimplementation of the end-to-end encryption Double Ratchet Algorithm aspopularised by Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Allo etc. As ofNovember 2016 the spec and library is finally finished and being unleashed onthe world, successfully audited by NCC Group, and is available as part ofMatrix's client SDKs for Web, iOS & Android and apps that use them (e.g.Riot.im).

    In this talk we will discuss Matrix's mission to be an open, global end-to-end-encrypted communications network - showing that it's possible to buildopen communication infrastructure which is both secure _and_ decentralised(unlike the silos of Signal, Wire, etc); where users can own their data andpick who they trust to run their service. We'll show how you can use Matrix tosecurely defragment communities scattered over proprietary silos such asSlack, Telegram and Gitter, open silos like Rocket.Chat and MatterMost -whilst also bridging to IRC, XMPP and even SIP.

    We'll also introduce the Megolm cryptographic ratchet - a new ratchet writtenby Matrix to tackle the specific problem of encrypting Matrix rooms, which mayhave thousands of users and require synchronised history over multiple devices(including new devices). Megolm is layered on top of the Olm ratchet, and isunusual in that it encrypts per-device rather than per-user, and lets roomsspecify how much scrollback may be decrypted by new devices: providing acustomisable trade-off between privacy and usability. This is a major stepforwards from other systems which unilaterally prioritise privacy overusability.

    Finally, we'll give a quick tour of all the FOSS clients, bots and bridgesthat the community has built on Matrix over the last year - ranging fromnative Qt clients (Quaternion, NaChat, Tensor), CLI apps (WeeChat), Reactwebapps (Riot, Freebird) to Native mobile apps (Riot).

    Matrix.org is a non-profit open source initiative dedicated to creating andmaintaining the Matrix open standard for decentralised communication, whosegoal is to create an open and secure ecosystem for interoperable messaging,VoIP and IoT communication on the internet.

    The goal of this talk is to give a simple insight of what quantum computingis, what makes it so different; to see when it poses a threat to existingcrypto solutions and when it is not.

    This talk will show what quantum computing is: how cubit is different from anordinary bit and what new opportunities this provides. We'll take a look atalgorithms important for cryptanalysis. QCL — a free software tool to simulatequantum computer will be discussed as well.

    In the second part of this talk an impact on widely used cryptographicalgorithms will be discussed. Algorithms resilient to quantum computing willbe reviewed. Codecrypt — a free GPG-like software for postquantum crypto willbe discussed.

    Note: this talk is intended to be an understandable overview, not a completelystrict and full introduction to the subject.

    _Erratum:_ As was noted after my talk by one of the listeners from the OxfordUniversity, slide 9 "Qubits: implementation" contains outdated informationabout quantum storage progress: the latest result allows to store it forseveral hours instead of 1.75 sec I mentioned. Impressive progress. Thank youfor your input, friend, sorry I don't know your name.

    WireGuard is a next generation VPN protocol, which lives in the Linux kernel,and uses state of the art cryptography. One of the most exciting recentcrypto-networking developments, WireGuard aims to drastically simplify securetunneling. The current state of VPN protocols is not pretty, with popularoptions, such as IPsec and OpenVPN, being overwhelmingly complex, with largeattack surfaces, using mostly cryptographic designs from the 90s. WireGuardpresents a new abuse-resistant and high-performance alternative based onmodern cryptography, with a focus on implementation and usability simplicity.It uses a 1-RTT handshake, based on NoiseIK, to provide perfect forwardsecrecy, identity hiding, and resistance to key-compromise impersonationattacks, among other important security properties, as well as highperformance transport using ChaCha20Poly1305. A novel IP-binding cookie MACmechanism is used to prevent against several forms of common denial-of-serviceattacks, both against the client and server, improving greatly on those ofDTLS and IKEv2. Key distribution is handled out-of-band with extremely shortCurve25519 points, which can be passed around in the likes of OpenSSH.Discarding the academic layering perfection of IPsec, WireGuard introduces theidea of a "cryptokey routing table", alongside an extremely simple and fullydefined timer-state mechanism, to allow for easy and minimal configuration;WireGuard is actually securely deployable in practical settings. In order torival the performance of IPsec, WireGuard is implemented inside the Linuxkernel, but unlike IPsec, it is implemented in less than 4,000 lines of code,making the implementation manageably auditable. These features converge tocreate an open source VPN utility that is exceedingly simple, yet thoroughlymodern and secure.

    The presentation will be divided up into several parts. First, there will bean overview of the problems with IPsec, OpenVPN, and other popular VPNs,outlining attacks and weaknesses. Next, the WireGuard idea of the "cryptokeyrouting table" will be introduced, and we’ll walk through several propertiesderived from it. This will transition into a discussion of the timer statemechanism, and how secure protocols are necessarily stateful, but it’spossible to make them appear stateless to the user by exhaustively definingall possible state transitions. Then we’ll get into the hardcore meat of thepresentation: the cryptography and various crypto innovations behindWireGuard. We will discuss the triple Diffie-Hellman, the role of combiningstatic and ephemeral keys, the performance and DoS-potential of Curve25519point multiplication, using a PRF chaining for rotating keys, identity hidingand remaining silent on a network, and clever usage of authenticatedencryption with additional data. We will examine the various attack models,and enumerate the cryptographic mitigations employed by WireGuard. The sumwill be a comprehensive overview of modern day crypto tricks, attacks, anduseful constructions, and how these insights have been funneled intoWireGuard. Finally, we’ll examine the Linux kernel implementation ofWireGuard, seeing how it’s possible to avoid allocations in response tounauthenticated packets as a defense coding technique. During thepresentation, a live WireGuard endpoint will be provided to audience memberswho wish to send packets, whether encrypted, legitimate, malformed, dubious,or otherwise curious.

    Threaded throughout will be an enumeration of attacks on existing protocolsand cryptographic tricks for their mitigation.

    My background is in security -- kernels, hardware, reversing, crypto, largenetworks, etc -- and as such I've broken a lot of systems with some noveltricks and protocol insights. WireGuard is motivated by a sort of cornucopiaof clever attacks (crypto and otherwise) against other networks. I made itbecause I wanted something I could actually confidently run on my owninfrastructure, and none of the other tools were nearly up to the task. So,this talk is going to go into depth about real attacks on various protocols,in addition to unveiling some techniques to avoid entire classes of attacks.

    Finally, since WireGuard is initially implemented for the Linux kernel, therehave been some very interesting considerations to account for with kernelprogramming. Cross platform implementations are also in the works, written inGo and Rust.

    The Mooltipass Offline Password Keeper project was started three years ago bya small community to provide a safe and offline way of storing credentials.

    Since then, about 50 individuals from around the globe have contributed to theproject, bringing two models of the Mooltipass device to market.

    Mooltipass devices are currently used by thousands of people, several majorcompanies, and government agencies. This talk will describe the Mooltipasshardware, firmware and software architectures with a focus on what it took tomove from idea to commercial product, while having all the development andproduction files publicly available on GitHub.

    While writing for Hack-a-Day, in December 2013 project creator Mathieu Stephanhad the crazy idea of creating an open hardware device using a team spread allover the globe. He posted a call for developers on hackaday.com, whichresulted in a team of 20 individuals. Over the course of three years, using avariety of free (Trello, Google groups, IRC) and open source (KiCad, Gimp,GCC) tools the Mooltipass team developed a complete solution composed of:

      * Firmware for the devices (AES encryption, storage management, graphics, random number generation, smartcard management)

      * Two models of physical device each composed of a PCB, case, screen, usb and smartcard connectors

      * Several open source software solutions to provide computer integration with the device, depending on the users' preferences: a cross platform daemon (Windows, Linux, Mac) [moolticute], a python management tool [mooltipy], a chrome and firefox extension, and a chrome app to provide native integration with websites

    Having a complete, unremunerated teamworking on the Mooltipass project duringtheir spare time created interesting management challenges, particularly withrespect to establishing and enforcing coding rules and commenting practices.The first crowdfunding campaign successfully raised $125k in December 2014,which was more than sufficient to start the ball rolling. The secondcrowdfunding campgin for the Mooltipass Mini raised $168k last October.

    The growing Python data science ecosystem, including the foundational packagesNumpy and Pandas, provides powerful tools for data analysis that are widelyused in a variety of applications. Typically, these libraries were designedfor data that fits in memory and for computations that run on a single core.

    Dask is a Python library for parallel and distributed computing, using blockedalgorithms and task scheduling. By leveraging the existing Python dataecosystem, Dask enables to compute on arrays and dataframes that are largerthan memory, while exploiting parallelism or distributed computing power, butin a familiar interface (mirroring Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes).

    When working with BigData & IoT systems we often feel the need for a CommonQuery Language. The platform specific languages are often harder to integratewith and require longer adoption time.

    To fill this gap many NoSql (Not-only-Sql) vendors are building SQL layers fortheir platforms. It is worth exploring the driving forces behind this trend,how it fits in your BigData stacks and how we can adopt it in our favoritetools. However building SQL engine from scratch is a daunting job andframeworks like Apache Calcite can help you with the heavy lifting. Calciteallow you to integrate SQL parser, cost-based optimizer, and JDBC with yourbig data system.

    Calcite has been used to empower many Big-Data platforms such as Hive, Spark,Drill Phoenix to name some.

    I will walk you through the process of building a SQL access layer for ApacheGeode (In-Memory Data Grid). I will share my experience, pitfalls andtechnical consideration like balancing between the SQL/RDBMS semantics and thedesign choices and limitations of the data system.

    Hopefully this will enable you to add SQL capabilities to your prefered NoSQLdata system.

    > It will be interesting to see what happens if an established NoSQL databasedecides to implement a reasonably standard SQL; the only predictable outcomefor such an eventuality is plenty of argument. \- NoSQL Distilled, MartinFowler - 2012

    The Relational Databases (RDBMS) are an essential component of the computingecosystem. Yet in the past decade we have witnessed a wave of alternative datamanagement technologies often branded as NoSQL and BigData - an ambiguous andlacking prescriptive definition names.

    To understand the NoSQL/BigData "movement" one need to understand the forcesfueling it:

      * The rise of Internet (Web, Mobile, IoT...) leading to Data {Volume, Velocity and Variety} challenges  * Object-relational impedance mismatch  * Cloud computing - Infrastructure Automation and Elasticity  * Shift from Integration to Application databases  * Data-Value vs. Storage-Cost Economics Shift

    The various approaches in addressing those challenges have led to a multitudeof over 150 commercially supported NoSQL/BigData platforms.

    Such diversity means that an organization will adopt a mixture of data storagetechnologies for handling different circumstances (Polyglot Persistence).

    How does an organization integrate the mix of data technologies?

    To fill the gap many NoSql/BigData vendors are (or are considering) buildingSQL and SQL-based layers for their platforms.

    It is worth exploring the driving forces behind this trend ...

    Large-scale data stream processing has come a long way to where it is today.It combines all the essential requirements of modern data analytics: subsecondlatency, high throughput and impressively, strong consistency. Apache Flink isa system that serves as a proof-of-concept of these characteristics and it ismainly well-known for its lightweight fault tolerance. Data engineers andanalysts can now let the system handle Terabytes of computational statewithout worrying about failures that can potentially occur.

    In this talk, I am going to explain all the fundamental challenges behindexactly-once processing guarantees in large-scale streaming in a simple andintuitive way. I will further guide you through the tricks and pitfalls thatwe faced in our effort to make state management easy to use, transparent andyet extraordinarily powerful. Finally, I will demonstrate how you can declarestate and the in-flight protocol that is running underneath your processingpipeline to guarantee that your computation will always run consistently anduninterrupted, until infinity.

    In more detail I am going to demonstrate the basic and extended versions ofABS (Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting) , our state-of-the-art decentralized,in-flight snapshotting algorithm tailored to the needs of a dataflow graph.ABS needs no global synchronisation and works purely in a decentralisedmanner. It is considered today as one of the most lightweight mechanisms forcheckpointing application state and has been developed even further togetherwith the rest of the Flink community with additional optimisations. In fact,other open source systems such as Apache Storm have also recently incorporatedthe same mechanism due to its simplicity and effectiveness. One of suchoptimisations that is currently being merged in the system, is the adaptationof the algorithm in graphs that contain cycles which I am also going to coverin this talk in more detail. Furthermore, I will also briefly explain ourcurrent efforts to incrementalize state snapshots to further balance the loadtrade-off of state checkpointing and recovery time.

Hopsis a new European distribution of Hadoop with a distributed metadataarchitecture and 16X the performance of HDFS. Hops also includes a human-friendly UI, called Hopsworks, with support for the Apache Zeppelin Notebook.We will show how users can run tensorflow programs in Apache Zeppelin on hugedatasets in Hadoop. Moreover, we will show how Hopsworks makes discovering anddownloading huge datasets a piece of cake with peer-to-peer sharing ofdatasets between Hopsworks clusters. Within minutes, you can installHopsworks, discover curated important datasets and download them to train DeepNeural networks using Tensorflow. Hops is the first Hadoop distribution tosupport Tensorflow. Hops and Hopsworks are both Apache v2 licensed projectsand have been developed primarily at KTH Royal Institute of Technology andSICS Swedish ICT in Stockholm.

Userscollaborate in projects that contain datasets. Data owners can give usersaccess to process data (but not download it, copy it outside of the project,or cross-link it with data outside the project). Hopsworks, thus, providesstronger access control guarantees than are available in Hadoop, enablingsenstive data to securely reside on shared Hadoop clusters.

Now learn about the follow-on project which expands the reachof NiFi to the edge, Apache MiNiFi. MiNiFi is a lightweight application whichcan be deployed on hardware orders of magnitude smaller and less powerful thanthe existing standard data collection platforms. With both a JVM compatibleand native agent, MiNiFi allows data collection in brand new environments —sensors with tiny footprints, distributed systems with intermittent orrestricted bandwidth, and even disposable or ephemeral hardware. Not only canthis data be prioritized and have some initial analysis performed at the edge,it can be encrypted and secured immediately. Local governance and regulatorypolicies can be applied across geopolitical boundaries to conform with legalrequirements. And all of this configuration can be done from central command &control using an existing NiFi with the trusted and stable UI data flowmanagers already love.

    HPC computing environment and especially super computing has its bag ofchallenges when it comes to software deployment. As scientists we often do notget root access which means that we either depend on what software isavailable or we build software in a dedicated directory using tools such asBrew, Conda or even from source. Unfortunately these solutions depend onalready installed tools from an underlying distribution, often proprietary ordated compilers, and, for example, modules. Any binary that gets produced,therefore, tends to be totally unique, both in the generated binary and itsset of dependencies. This is bad, both for trouble shooting and for pursuingreproducible science. With GNU Guix we are developing a fully reproduciblefree software stack including all dependencies targeting cross-builds forheterogeneous computing environments, such as the Beacon Intel PHI-basedsupercomputer, without having a requirement for containers. In this talk Iwill describe the challenges we are overcoming and what it will mean for theHPC community to have architecture optimized and fully reproducible buildtargets that can be deployed in a non-root, non-container environment.

    EasyBuild is a framework for building and installing (scientific) software onHPC clusters, implemented in Python and available under the GPLv2 FOSSlicense. It has served HPC support teams well on standard Linux/x86 systemssince 2012.

    More recently, interest has grown to also employ EasyBuild on Cray systems,where the Cray Programming Environment (PE) not only provides common tools(compilers, ...) and libraries (MPI, BLAS/LAPACK, FFTW, ...), but also tunedinstallations of 3rd party libraries like HDF5, netCDF and PETSc. The Cray PEconsists of an extensive stack of environment modules, providing a familiaryet complex working environment of users.

    To leverage the Cray PE a couple of enhancements had to be made to EasyBuild,including support for using 'external' modules, and defining Cray-specificcompiler toolchains. In addition, the way in which EasyBuild deals withenvironment modules had to be carefully revisited, since standard operationslike 'module purge' are not supported by the Cray PE.

    This work has led to the use of EasyBuild in production on the largest Craysupercomputer in Europe, the Piz Daint system at the Swiss NationalSupercomputing Centre.

    In this talk, we will outline how Cray systems are different from standard HPCsystems, motivate the need for a tool like EasyBuild despite the presence ofCray PE, and show how EasyBuild was tweaked to support reproducible softwareinstallations on Cray systems.

    We believe this is interesting success story of how FOSS has significantlyenhanced the software environment on a multi-million dollar production system.

    With the advent of modern package managers for scientific applications(EasyBuild, Spack, etc.) automated building of large amounts of software isbecoming easier, quickly giving rise to issues related to life cyclemanagement of applications. This makes tracking the applications and librariesthat actually get used considerably more important. Existing solutions (moduleload hooks, launch wrappers) do not account for user-built software, are hardto deploy or produce inconclusive results.

    OGRT enables the tracking of jobs on a cluster with process-level granularityand without discernible performance penalty. It tracks used shared libraries,environment variables and loaded modules at the moment of process execution.It also supports watermarking executables and shared objects and reading thosewatermarks out of memory at runtime. Gathered information is collected andshipped to various backends.

    OGRT aims to be a versatile tool, which can be used to:

      * provide a census of used software (including user-built)  * troubleshoot problems with programs picking up unexpected shared libraries  * retroactively inform users about buggy libraries  * overlay process-level data onto existing job monitoring tools  * contribute to reproducibility of application runs

    This presentation will give an overview of the design and implementation ofOGRT, as well as demoing some of its capabilities when plugged into anElasticsearch backend.

    A lot of components in the Kafka and hadoop ecosystem assume you are workingwith avro messages. In this talk I will highlight some of the advantages andchallenges of stream processing with protobuf encoded messages, and why itmight be worth using them.

    A powerful feature of protobuf messages is its handling of unknown fields, andthe ability to partially parse messages with different schema versions or noschema at all. This helps in stream processing when you don't actually need toknow all message fields in order to process and forward them.

    To offer supercomputing services to all Cuban institutes of higher education,research centers and industrial partners is the mission set forth by a groupof ambitious young system administrators working at various universities ofthe lush Caribbean island of Cuba. With the assistance of the Flemish Inter-university Council (VLIR), lots of hard work and hardware donations by GhentUniversity they have succeeded in setting up a nation-spanning architecturecomprised of three datacenters, in Havana (West), Santa Clara (central) andSantiago de Cuba (East). Their campuses are spread geographically across the1000 km long island and are interconnected by a 20 Mbps network that covers upto the furthest regions of the island where remote rural universities aregiven the opportunity to take advantage of the magnificent capacities ofmassive parallel processing.

    Thus was born "HPC Cuba" the national center for academic supercomputing.While fully depending on Free Software for their operations, HPC Cuba has alsojoined the global Free Software community by producing installation packagesfor software not yet covered by EasyBuild.

    On a tropical island where access to resources is being limited by a USimposed trade embargo, setting up a datacenter capable of hosting a propersupercomputer "no es fácil" ("it is not easy", a Cuban saying). Come learnabout the specific challenges poised in the Cuban context, calling forresourceful solutions and unique problem-solving capacities standing proof ofthe high standard of the universities of this so-called third world countryand its relentless human resources.

    We present the pure functional array language, Futhark, along with itsoptimising GPU-targeting compiler. Of particular focus are the languagetradeoffs necessary to ensure the ability to efficiently generate high-performance GPU code from a high-level parallel language. We also demonstrate(nested) data-parallel array programming, a programming paradigm that enablesconcise programming of massively parallel systems. We show how Futhark codecan be easily integrated with larger applications written in other language.Finally, we report benchmarks showing that Futhark is able to match theperformance of hand-written code on various published benchmarks.

    GPUs and other massively parallel systems are now common, yet programming themis often a painful experience. Languages are often low-level and fragile, withcareful hand-optimisation necessary to obtain good performance. The programmeris often forced to write highly coupled code with little modularity. The high-level languages that exist, often functional in nature, are ofteninsufficiently flexible, or poor performes in practice. We present our work ona programming language that seeks a common ground between imperative andfunctional approaches.

    Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficientGPU code. It is a statically typed, data-parallel, and purely functional arraylanguage, and comes with a heavily optimising ahead-of-time compiler thatgenerates GPU code via OpenCL. Futhark is not designed for graphicsprogramming, but instead uses the compute power of the GPU to accelerate data-parallel array computations. We support regular nested data-parallelism, aswell as a form of imperative-style in-place modification of arrays, whilestill preserving the purity of the language via the use of a uniqueness typesystem.

    The Futhark language and compiler is an ongoing research project. It cancompile nontrivial programs which then run on real GPUs at high speed. TheFuthark compiler employs a set of optimisations (fusion, flattening,distribution, tiling, etc) to shield the programmer from having to know thedetails of the underlying hardware. The Futhark language itself is still veryspartan - due to the basic design criteria requiring the ability to generatehigh-performance GPU code, it takes more effort to support language featuresthat are common in languages with more forgiving compilation targets.Nevertheless, Futhark can already be used for nontrivial programs, and hasbeen used to port several real-world benchmark applications, with performancecomparable to original hand-written GPU (OpenCL or CUDA) code.

    Futhark is not intended to replace existing general-purpose languages. Ourintended use case is that Futhark is only used for relatively small butcompute-intensive parts of an application. The Futhark compiler generates codethat can be easily integrated with non-Futhark code. For example, you cancompile a Futhark program to a Python module that internally uses PyOpenCL toexecute code on the GPU, yet looks like an ordinary Python module from theoutside.

    I have been involved with Fedora Community Operations Team where I mostlycontribute on community-metrics related tasks. This talk will be about a NLP-based tool I have built for Fedora wiki to make wiki-gardening tasks easierfor contributors, the methods I used for building it and how it can be scaledto any other wiki.

    Fedora wiki is a community documentation space about different projects,initiatives, contributors in Fedora Project. However, due to large size of theproject, the Fedora wiki has been growing in size and has become difficult tomanage. As a result, wiki gardening tasks were born. These tasks generallyinvolve not only updating current information on wiki pages but alsoidentifying pages with redundant information to merge them, marking pages withold and outdated information accordingly etc.Most of these wiki gardeningtasks are a part of one-day FADs, hackathons or sprints and suitable for newcontributors looking to contribute to the project as they have a low entry-barrier. While there has been a category traditionally to mark wiki pageswhich need to be worked on, this task is mostly manual(needs to be done bysome contributor prior to the hackathon or event) and also doesn't cover thewhole wiki as it is manually difficult due to it's large size.

    My tool uses Natural Language Processing-based techniques to 1.Identify pageswith redundant information so that contributors can merge/delete them2.Identify pages in a specific category/topic which need to be worked on.3.Identify old pages which might need to be updated or categorized as out-of-date

    To make the tool faster, I have used Parallel Processing techniques. In thistalk, I would like to describe the tool and it's functionality, the methods Iused for building it and how it can be scaled to any other wiki. I would alsolike to hear feedback on other wiki gardening tasks this tool could possiblybe used for, and how to scale it to automatically merge pages with redundantinformation.

    Traditional container technology (i.e. Docker) was not meant for thedeployment of HPC applications among large computing clusters. New containertechnology like Singularity focuses on the portability of compute, allowing usto ease deployment, reducing administrative overhead and user support.However, some issues still need special attention, for example how to handledifferent MPI configurations (e.g. over Infiniband), and how to handle specialresources like GPUs.

    Today, there is no need to have applications installed on any cluster orHPC/scientific resource; we can use container technology to encapsulate allthe software and libraries of any specific application, ensuring the operationthereof in any possible operating system, software, and hardware architecture,avoiding incompatibilities and retaining native or near-native performance.Our design strategy makes the container agnostic to the queue system i.e. thecontainer works with SLURM, TORQUE and stand alone.

    This talk will cover creating such portable containers using multipleresources, and showing how simple is to deploy a complex MPI dependantapplication across multiple TOP500 supercomputer with only a regular useraccount, including the ability to exploit existing resources like Infinibandand GPGPUs.

    Also we’ll show how to add open source profiling tools to the container. Weare going to show execution profiling samples of critical HPC/ML applicationslike VASP, Amber, Seismic Imaging and Chainer running on portable containersacross different HPC systems.

    The world is not perfect and network failures do happen. Complaining aboutinstability might not always be enough. Especially when your system depends onmultiple networked services and each of them is on a critical path to thefinal result.

    This talk will follow a real story of an attempt to implement network errorshandling by retries functionality that is inside urllib3 and requests Pythonlibraries. More importantly we will simulate poor network conditions on alocal machine using Linux Network Emulator and then will reason on howeffective the attempt was and what can be further improved.

    This is a proper treatment the networked systems should get when they aredesigned, developed and tested. And it is great that all the tools necessaryare already there in most popular Linux distributions.

    Static analyzers are automated tools that spot bugs in source code by scanningprograms without running them. They complement traditional dynamic testing:Where testing allows individual runs through a piece of software to be checkedfor correctness, static analysis allows multiple and sometimes even all flowsto be checked at once. Infer is an open-source static analyzer that is usedinternally at Facebook to analyze the main apps for Android and iOS, FacebookMessenger, and WhatsApp, among others. Infer reports bugs responsible for appcrashes and performance issues, such as accessing null pointers, and leakingresources such as Context instances.

    Each month, hundreds of potential bugs identified by Infer are fixed by ourdevelopers before they are committed to our codebases and deployed to people'sphones.

    This talk will present Infer and show how it can be integrated as part of thedevelopment workflow.

    strace is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional utility for Linux. It isused to monitor interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, whichinclude system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state. In2016, strace has been extended to tamper with tracees using syscall faultinjection, making strace also a syscall fault injection tool, the onlyunprivileged userspace command-line runtime tool of this kind for Linux.

    The last summer as a part of strace GSoC 2016 project Nahim El Atmani hasimplemented a prototype of syscall fault injection - a software testingtechnique used for improving test coverage of error handling code paths thatmight otherwise rarely be followed by introducing faults. Now the feature hasfinally been implemented and is a part of strace 4.15 released in December2016.

    In this talk the maintainer of strace will demonstrate the new feature,describe its implementation, and show examples of real bugs found with itshelp.

    years tosupport mobile development. As more companies are developing mobile productsand
    the marketplace is seeing more devices, platforms, and versions, testingyour mobile
    apps is vital. When it comes choosing what mobile testing tool isright for you,
    there is a huge array of options, each with different strengthsand weaknesses.At
    same time there are lot of challenges involved in automatinga mobile applications
    like inspecting the objects, parallel testing to makethe product custom fit in
    agile life cycle, Native framework support,Wearables/tvOS support etc. And we
    are going to see how Appium with the helpof other tools handles these problems
    to steal the future\n\nProblems faced by Mobile testers and how Appium provides
    solution for it.\n\n1) Xpath Locator Strategies - completely depending on the
    xml hierarchy thatapp renders\n\n                - Locator strategies are quite
    improved by replacing the android-bootstrap implementation with actively maintained
    google’s droiddriver implementation to locate objects effectively    - Issue e.g
    Unable to select individual elements in UIATableView by Xpath -https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/6517
    \   - add invisible elements to uiautomator2 page source https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/4369
    \   \n\n2)Inspector:\n\n            - Limitation of Appium Inspector & Calabsh’s
    IRB - completely depends on the application page source rendered by either instruments
    UIAutomation or UIAutomatorViewer which in turn fails on many cases depending
    on the technology used  to develop app,instruments UIAutomation known issues which
    doesn’t render UITableCollectionviewcells often,not so user friendly,etc    -
    This been overcome by Facebook’s webdriveragent & its inspector which has more
    control over the device not just the application        - appuim inspector isn't
    maintained. we recommend users inspect via uiautomatorviewer    \n\n3)UIAutomation
    support is over from Xcode 8 beta:\n\n            - Apple has lifted their support
    of UIAutomation from Xcode 10 hence automation libraries or tools depending on
    native framework won’t work from iOS 9.Apple has an alternative solution of XCUITests
    to automate app’s but the API’s of XCUITests are completely broken on many cases
    \   - Facebook’s WDA uses XCUITest for automation which fixed many of broken XCUITest
    API’s    - Appium has already adopted FB’s WDA which inturn support’s future iOS
    automation through XCUITest Driver called appium-xcuitest-driver    - Instruments
    Memory leak will get over with this new approach    \n\n4)UIAutomator 2 Framework:\n\n
    \           - Issues in Google’s Framework: UiAutomator V2 finding objects which
    are not identifiable with UiAutomatorViewer. https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=207569
    \   - uiAutomatorviewer not in sync with V2 implementation    - project architecture
    in appium    - https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/4869    - https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/4858
    \   - -support Toast Messages on Android    -get the text from a password field
    \   \n\n5)Handling Multiple Sessions at a time\n\n            - Parallel Execution
    on iOS real device    - Parallel Execution on iOS Simulators (Will be supported

    Cybersecurity is a broad topic and many commercial products are related to it.We demonstrate a fundamental concept in network analysis: re-construction andvisualization of temporal networks. Furthermore, we apply the method todescribe operational conditions of a Hadoop cluster. Our experiments providefirst results and allow a classification of the cluster state related tocurrent workloads. The temporal networks show significant differences fordifferent operation modes. In reallity we would expect mixed workloads. Ifsuch workload parameters are known, we are able to handle a-typical eventsaccordingly - which means, we are able to create alerts based on contextinformation, rather than only the package content. We show an end-to-endexample: (1) Data collection is done via python, using the sniffer script; (2)using Apache Hive and Apache Spark we analyze the network traffic data andcreate the temporary network. Finally, we are able to visualize the resultsusing Gephi in step (3). In a next step, we plan to contribute to the ApacheSpot project.

In contrast, frequent subgraph mining (FSM), thegraphy variant of frequent itemset mining, not only evaluates entity co-occurrence but also relationships among entities, i.e., structural patterns.However, existing implementations are all research prototypes which aretailored to textbook problems.

    In our talk, we want to give an introduction to the FSM problem on distributedcollections of graphs and our implementation in Gradoop, an open source systemfor scalable graph analytics based on Apache Flink. In contrast to otheriterative graph algorithms like page rank, in FSM the search space is droppedbut intermediate results of iterations are the desired result. Here, the majortechnical challenge is the respective usage of Flinks’ distributed iterations.

    We will explain different implementation approaches, discuss implementationdetails which influence scalability and show benchmark results.

    Intended audience and goal of the talk: Developers and analysts, interested inrelationship-centric data mining techniques

    While a lot of languages already have comprehensive libraries to handle graphdata (like [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) in python), the same cannotbe said for JavaScript.

    This talk discusses how we were driven to create a multipurpose graph objectspecification for JavaScript and what were the design issues we soon had totackle from implementation choices to API naming.

    The result of this work is the [graphology](https://graphology.github.io/)specification & reference implementation which we present to open it tofeedbacks & contributions.

    * * *

    We will first review the state of the art of graph libraries for JavaScriptand discuss the issues which brought us to create a new projet from scratch.

    Then we will explain why we chose to design an open specification for astandard API rather than only providing a library.

    Finally we will present the reference implementation & the attached library ofalgorithms and justify the technical choices made, before presenting ourfuture roadmap and related projects (a new version of the graph renderinglibrary, [sigma.js](http://sigmajs.org/), notably).

    With the recent announcement of the SAP HANA, express edition, a free to useand streamlined version of SAP HANA that can run on laptops and otherresource-constrained hosts, it is now possible to use the SAP HANA Graphfunctionality for free in own graph projects and applications with up to 32GBmain memory limit. In addition, the SAP HANA, express edition offersdevelopment utilities that can be used to develop own applications on top ofSAP HANA.

    In this presentation, we will provide an overview of SAP HANA Graph, a nativegraph processing engine, which is tightly integrated into the database kernelof SAP HANA. It allows to freely combine graph, relational, text, andgeospatial processing on a single transactional data representation withoutthe need to replicate data into specialized systems. In particular, we willuse the SAP HANA, express edition running on the speaker's laptop todemonstrate the audience a walk-through of the steps to get started with SAPHANA Graph. Specifically, we will show how to execute openCypher queries inSAP HANA and also showcase GraphScript, a high-level domain-specific graphquery language for imperative and complex graph query processing.

    How can we evaluate a global query on huge graphs in 0.1 seconds? Given ourcurrent technology, that would be magic. The lack of wizarding skills did notstop us, however, from tackling the problem by using smart caching structures,which are witchcrafts on their own.

    Why is this challenge important? Several applications evaluate global querieson continuously changing graphs: [fraud detection in financialtransactions](https://neo4j.com/resources/recommendations-business-white-paper/), [analysis of source coderepositories](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/pub/stein-daniel-static-analysis.pdf) and [validating engineeringmodels](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11653-2_40).Current approaches employ domain-specific optimizations, which are difficultand error-prone to implement. Meanwhile, the requirements of these (andsimilar) use cases could be uniformly addressed by incremental graph queryevaluation. With this technique, the first execution of the queries takes sometime, but once the result are calculated, they can be efficiently maintainedfor each change in the graph.

    To allow incremental queries on property graphs, we implemented the[ingraph](https://github.com/FTSRG/ingraph) engine, based on the[openCypher](http://www.opencypher.org/) language specification. We aim tosupport the [standardsubset](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/standardisation-scope.adoc) of openCypher, as most standard constructs can be calculatedincrementally. We already mapped some of the standard constructs to[relational algebra](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/pub/opencypher-report.pdf), defined [incremental relational algebraicoperators](http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/preprints/perpol2016-gqo.pdf) andimplemented them in an [incremental relationalengine](https://github.com/FTSRG/ire) using [Akka](http://akka.io/) actors.

    We start the talk by presenting use cases that evaluate complex global querieson continuously changing graphs and discuss the idea of incremental graphqueries. We show the mapping of basic openCypher constructs (e.g. `MATCH`,`WHERE`, `WITH`, `RETURN`) to relational operators, such as joins, selectionsand projections. Finally, we show our approach for optimizing incrementalgraph queries and outline related challenges.

    Target audience: Developers, looking for a deeper understanding of openCypherand/or facing complex queries on continuously changing graphs

    Presentation of the original vision of the Twitter Stream Importer, from startto current situation with "experience feedback". If possible showing a demoreal-time and "open discussion" about improvement on going, visualisationusage etc...

    Since some years now, the particularity of Twitter is to be "reactive" or realtime compare to other Social Network.

    The massive stream of data generated by some events (going from Tv shows tomore serious event) can't be digested with traditional tools (Twittdecketc...). The visual representation of a twitter activity could help to revealinsights on a running topic. Graph allows to contextualize and visualise theinteraction between users and thematic within this topic.

    To do that, the Twitter Stream Importer brings tools to start tracking a topicand visualise data with different "Network logic" that act like a particularprojection of the data. The integration within Gephi then, makes easy to usethe integrated tools (statistics, filter, exports) to works easily on yousubject.

    We will see what are the main concept, what are the pro and cons and thefollowing evolution of the plugin.

    Traditionally CMSs use SQL databases that are really fast when you need allthe information stored together in a record row, but are a bad fit when youneed to search for relationship patterns that are not already stored togetherin your database. A significant performance penalty is incurred for everyadditional table that needs to be joined for a query. That is why SQLdatabases are notoriously bad at deducting relationships from datasets. Graphdatabases however are really good at this task. In this talk we discusspotential application areas of graph databases in existing open source CMSslike Drupal.

    We believe graph databases could make a big difference when used in key areaswhere traditionally CMSs would fail: Explore large non-uniform datasets: Neo4jgot a lot of attention after it was used by investigative journalists to[identify the organisations and individuals involved in offshore tax evasionin the Panama papers leak](https://neo4j.com/blog/analyzing-panama-papers-neo4j/). Recommend content: Media companies like [the Financial Times areusing Neo4j to display relatedcontent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k47aC01Uy64&ab_channel=Neo4j-theWorld%27sLeadingGraphDatabase)on their website, this helps them to increase engagement with higherclickthrough rates. Personalisation: [Addidas uses the Neo4j graph database tocreate it’s internal metadata service](https://neo4j.com/news/adidas-neo4j-customer-experience/), offering access and searchability to their dataand making sense of complex interdependencies and relationships.

    We've created a basic integration that makes it possible for non-developers towork with Neo4j. Combined with Drupal’s content modelling capabilities webelieve it could be a powerful tool for people to explore graph databasesusing a GUI. There is also a case to be made for the use of graph databases inthe Drupal ecosystem: sites that already use Drupal could benefit from itscapabilities.

    In the era of docker, big data and micro services it is really important todistribute your applications reasonable across your cluster and keep a goodoverview of all of your applications. This fact is well addressed, but itwould be great to utilize your cluster in that way, that you locate your datain the same cluster like the rest of your application landscape and share yourphysical resources all over your running applications, no matter if you areserving user requests, crunching data or calculating big graphs. For thisreason we brought the awesome graph database Neo4j to run natively on top ofApache Mesos and DC/OS. In this session we will see how easy it is to install,run, operate and scale out Neo4j Causal Clusters on top of Apache Mesos andDC/OS and which possibilities you have spanning big graphs across yourcluster.

    As graph processing moves to the mainstream, a large number of specializedgraph engines have emerged. However, for many enterprises, much of theirimportant data resides in relational databases and SQL is the most commonworkload. So is it reasonable to suggest that relational data processingengines can be used to solve graph problems in a productive and performantmanner?

    The answer to this question is: “Yes!”

    In this talk, we will address the use of massively parallel processing (MPP)databases for graph analytics workloads. We will share some recent findingsfrom the Apache MADlib (incubating) project, including design of graph datastructures, implementation of common graph algorithms, and performanceresults.

    Graph analytics is becoming an important part of enterprise computing. Withroots in academia going back many decades, the last 10-15 years have seen ahuge surge of interest in this topic to address a wide range of modern usecases, from cybersecurity to social networks to supply distribution chains.

    Enterprises have made significant investments in infrastructure, software, andtraining of their employees, all centered around SQL. So how can an enterpriseadd graph analytics to their business without the cost and complexity ofmoving to specialized graph processing engines? And, what are the tradeoffs?

    Graph analytics is a new area of innovation in Apache MADlib, which is a SQL-based open source library for scalable in-database analytics. It providesparallel implementations of mathematical, statistical and machine learningmethods for structured and unstructured data.

    Many existing analytics products do not scale in a way that makes itconvenient and economical to operate on large data sets. The graph methods inApache MADlib have been designed to take advantage of the shared-nothing,scale-out parallelism offered by modern parallel database engines.

    I look forward to presenting this topic at FOSDEM 17!

    ### Abstract

    Graph pattern matching is one of the most interesting and challengingoperations in graph analytics. However, it is primarily supported by graphdatabase systems such as Neo4j but, besides research prototypes, not generallyavailable for distributed (not-only graph) processing frameworks like ApacheFlink or Apache Spark.

    In our talk, we want to give an overview of our current implementation ofCypher on Apache Flink. Cypher is the Neo4j graph query language and enablesthe intuitive definition of graph patterns including structural and semanticpredicates. As the Neo4j graph data model is not supported out-of-the box byApache Flink, we leverage Gradoop, a Flink-based graph analytics frameworkbased on Apache Flink that already provides an abstraction of schema-freeproperty graphs.

    We will give a brief overview about the technologies used to implement Cypher,explain our query engine and give a demonstration of the available languagefeatures. Finally, we will discuss open challenges and missing featureshopefully motivating people to contribute.

    The project is a cooperation between the University of Leipzig and NeoTechnology.

    Boost.Geometry is a C++ library defining concepts, primitives and algorithmsfor solving geometry problems. It contains a dimension-agnostic, coordinate-system-agnostic and scalable kernel, on top of which algorithms are built:area, distance, convex hull, intersection, within, simplify and much more. Thelibrary contains instantiable geometry classes, but library users can also usetheir own legacy geometry types. It also contains spatial index allowing toperform spatial and knn queries on a collection of geometries.

    Boost.Geometry might be used in all domains where geometry plays a role:mapping and GIS, game development, computer graphics and widgets, robotics,astronomy and more. The core is designed to be generic and support thosedomains.

    This introductory talk will be followed by a talk discussing the use ofBoost.Geometry in GIS domain in more detail as it is used for example inMySQL.

    Following up the introductory talk on Boost.Geometry we discuss thealgorithmic, the implementation as well as the user perspective of thedevelopment of geography in Boost.Geometry. We define basic geometric objectssuch as geodesics, and the modeling of the Earth as a sphere or ellipsoid. Wetry to understand the effect of different Earth models to the accuracy andspeed of fundamental geometric algorithms (such as length, area, intersectionetc.) by showing particular examples. Finally, we are having a look towardsthe future of geography in Boost.Geometry.

    With the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) on the one hand, andthe availability of Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm [1] in theopensource Micmac [2, 3, 4] software suite (French National GeographicInstitute, IGN) for generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and orthophotoson the other hand, we describe the processing chain to acquire andgeoereference DEMs in QGIS. The fast acquisition and very high (sub-meter)resolution are well suited for repeated measurements and assess terrainmorphological changes. The processing sequence is

      1. fly and acquire georeferenced images. If only a GPS receiver and camera are aboard the UAV, matching time tag with GPS date and time will allow for georeferencing the pictures (exiftool)

      2. identify matching points between adjacent images: the GPS position is used to reduce the number of comparisons and limit the lengthy analysis to nearest neighbors

      3. identify lens properties, bringing the largest cause of uncertainty in the model generation, from various pictures of the same ground feature exhibiting as much height variation as possible,

      4. generate coarse point cloud to assess camera position and matching algorithm consistency

      5. generate dense point cloud, orthophoto and DEM

      6. include the resulting georeferenced pointcloud in QGis, converting the (arbitrary TIF) pixel value to quantitative height (meters).

    We demonstrate sub-meter resolution DEM generation in vegetation-lessenvironments (urban, glacier moraine) while coarse-acquisition (C/A) single-frequency GPS only allows for 5-m accuracy, hence requiring an additionalground control point matching step for repeated DEM comparison.

    This presentation is a shortened sequel to the [FOSS4G presentation given in2016](http://jmfriedt.free.fr/foss4g_2016) (in French at the moment) focusingon UAV azimutal images.

    Location-based applications grow in importance, not only for the augmentedreality gaming community, but also for businesses adding location-awarefunctionality to their web applications, mobile apps and the like. We show howto work with the vast set of OpenStreetMap data with minimal Pythonprogramming and very little resources using the OSMAlchemy library.

    In this workshop, we will create a web application that uses the live set ofOpenStreetMap data to allow users to review places like restaurants, bars andthe like. Doing so, we will use the following technologies:

      * the Python programming language  * the Flask micro-framework for web applications  * an SQLite database  * the SQLAlchemy object-relational mapper  * the OSMAlchemy library  * the Angular.JS framework

    When writing applications that use OpenStreetMap, one had to decide whether toonly use a really small subset of the data or maintain their own local copy ofthe whole planet data, which accumulates to more than 1 TB of data andconsumes a lot of resources to work with it. OSMAlchemy provides access to thelive data through the Overpass API in combination with a local, SQLAlchemy-based cache. It also allows access to the complete set of OpenStreetMap databy simply querying SQLAlchemy, without even caring about Overpass API access.

    After attending the workshop, you will be able to implement arbitraryapplications using whatever OpenStreetMap features you like. You should havesome basic knowledge about Python and relational databases. Having heard aboutFlask, REST and SQLAlchemy gives you an extra bonus, but is not strictlynecessary. If you want to try the examples during the workshop, please makesure to have the most recent (stable) versions of Python 3, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Restless and OSMAlchemy installed beforehand.

    GIS development was ramped up in MySQL 5.7, and we expect GIS support to begreatly improved in the coming versions. MySQL 8.0 is still in development,but we're starting to see the first GIS enhancements pushed into developmentreleases. What is new? In which direction is MySQL going?

    In this talk, we will look at the plans for GIS in future versions of MySQL,and in MySQL 8.0 in particular. We'll cover the big overarching designdecisions, what it means for the future direction of GIS in MySQL, and how ittranslates into implementation of specific new functionality.

    This talk is both for those that know GIS and would like to know what MySQLcan offer, and for those that know MySQL GIS today and want to know what toexpect in future versions.

    Khartis results from an observation: how can we create easily a statisticalmap, with a few clicks, without loosing the scientific accuracy and rigorwhile processing the data? Khartis is not the first mapping tool availableonline! It is, however, one of the few to propose different perspectives ofthe world representation among which the cartographer will choose. In order tofeed the tool with data, you may want to retrieve from the Khartis website thedata used to produce the maps given as examples or to import or copy / pasteyour own datasets. The base maps are geo-referenced and allow you to work onthe proposed entities (countries, regions...) but also on objects identifiedby pairs of coordinates. You can choose between several projections (besidesMercator) and configure the visual appearance of your data.

    With the advent of the massive deluge in Earth data, serving them to diversecommunities is increasingly promising and challenging alike. A usefulabstraction for spatio-temporal raster data (and beyond) is the coverage datamodel, as standardized by ISO, OGC, and INSPIRE. Rather than zillions ofindividual image files it provides spatio-temporal "datacubes" for simple,efficient handling through the corresponding service model, the Web CoverageService (WCS) with its Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) geo analyticslanguage - "one cube tells more than a million images".

    Open-source rasdaman ("raster data manager") is the official referenceimplementation of both OGC and INSPIRE WCS. It supports easy incrementalconstruction and maintenance of spatio-temporal datacubes, based on the OGCWCS-T standard. Retrieval may use WMS for visual navigation, WCS for dataextraction and download, and WCPS for massive server-side processing. Onserver side, adaptive data partitioning and "tile streaming" processingenables fast query responses. In July 2016, US magazine CIO Review hasincluded rasdaman in its top 100 Big Data technologies list.

    In this talk we present coverages in terms of concepts, implementation, andlarge-scale application. Live demos underpin the talk, using publiclyaccessible sites where the audience can replay and modify the examples. Beingeditor of the OGC and ISO coverage standard the presenter can give first-handsinsights and answers, such as about the new generalized grid model forcoverages (CIS 1.1) which OGC has adopted in Fall 2016 as well as the newlyadopted INSPIRE-WCS. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about the stateof the art and standards in an open, free-of-cost setup.

    Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) schemes are widely used in manyexisting communication systems and standards. On Software Defined Radio (SDR)platforms, separating the channels can prove more difficult though due to highrequirements for the digital filters. This talk will showcase animplementation of a polyphase filterbank on a graphics processor unit (GPU)that can help overcome the heavy computational load of those filters. In thesoftware, all the partitioned filters can run in parallel. Each of thesefilters produces output samples for numerous input samples simultaneously,thus providing an additional parallel approach. Furthermore, several rationaloversampling factors are supported by this implementation. Operations foroversampling can as well be implemented to run in parallel, due to the massiveamount of usable hardware threads in a GPU. Hence, the effects of oversamplingon the throughput can be reduced. On an Nvidia GTX970 GPU, this implementationachieved a throughput of 67.43 MSamples per second, 12 times higher than the(optimized) general purpose processor (GPP) version.

    Separating information using the frequency space is rather simple if one cando it with appropriate hardware. Cycle accurate operations executed in FPGAand ASIC fabric allows one to carefully create the desired waveform and thencontrol filterbanks and oscillators. This way, the desired information can getinto the air at the exact time and frequency one fancies. Unfortunately,controlling a software defined radio (SDR) in that manner can prove to bequite a challenge. Timing constraints when changing the center frequency oftenturn out to be the main limiting factor [1]. Instead, a pure SDR approach isoften the desired way of generating multifrequency content. To cope with hardlatency/timing constraints, the solution is to generate the whole spectrum atonce and to position the desired information digitally into the time/frequencymatrix.

    But this poses quite a challenge as one usually, depending on the number ofchannels, has to tremendously oversample the signal to generate the aggregatedbandwidth. The needed anti-imaging filter at the transmitter side and theseparation/anti-aliasing filters on the receiver side can grow to obsceneamounts of filter taps. Coping with this amount of computational load can bedemanding, even for high-end general purpose processors (GPP). Using apolyphase filterbank (PFB) to do the synthesis/separation of the waveform canhelp eminently with reducing the computational load. PFBs do this by breakingdown the needed filter in several polyphase partitions and doing the filteringon these partitions. A division of a filter in M polyphase partitions canalready reduce the theoretical computational load by exactly a factor of M[2]. Additionally, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can be used to extract orgenerate all channels needed at once, using just one filteringoperation.Still, the challenge of separating the channels can prove to be toomuch for the GPP, even with the help of a PFB channelizer/synthesizer.

    Using a graphics processor unit (GPU) can help immensely with offloading thecritical task of separating the dedicated channels, providing some headroomfor the GPP to perform the remaining task of decoding the informationimprinted on the individual channels. Filtering itself is an operation thatcan be mapped pretty well onto many-core architectures, especially if theconstraints on latency and buffer sizes are not as stringent. But theoperations inside a PFB really seem to be made for over the topparallelization. The notion of performing several independent polyphasepartitioned filtering operations at once is something that can be easilymapped onto common GPU architecture abstractions, as every polyphase filterpartition can run simultaneously.

    Most GPUs have even more computing capabilities and their resources would lieidle if one only parallelized the PFB algorithm in terms of polyphasepartitions. Additionally, the computation of consecutive output samples isindependent from each other. So one can further parallelize the algorithm bycomputing several output samples concurrently. If the need for oversampling ofthe signal arises, that too can be exploited to produce the additional outputsamples in parallel, thereby minimizing the additional computational stresscaused by oversampling.

    This talk will showcase, how all operations of the algorithm of the PFBchannelizer/synthesizer can be mapped to a GPU using the CUDA framework.Examples of the code will be shown to highlight some of the oddities one canencounter when developing code for GPUs or many-core architectures in general.Benchmarks and results of the current implementation will be presented anddiscussed. As of now, on an Nvidia GTX970, the implementation reaches athroughput of 67.43 MSamples per second (45 channels, 5x oversampling, 1318tap prototype filter), which is 12 times higher than an optimized GPP (IntelI7 6850K) version. Last but not least, future steps for releasing andmaintaining the code will be laid out.

    [DCF-77](https://www.ptb.de/cms/fileadmin/internet/fachabteilungen/abteilung_4/4.4_zeit_und_frequenz/pdf/2011_PTBMitt_50a_DCF77_engl.pdf)is a German very low frequency (VLF) emitter locked on the Cs clocks of PTBused for synchronizing radiofrequency-disciplined clocks found, for example,in low-cost weather stations. VLF signals propagate through the waveguidewhose boundary conditions are defined on the one hand by ground, and on theother hand by the ionosphere (charged) layer altitude. In addition to theamplitude modulation of the Cs-locked DCF-77 frequency standard, a [phasemodulation](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dcf77/dcf77-phase-modulation.html) is imprinted on the carrierfor time of flight measurement, allowing for "precise" time of flightmeasurements. The topic of the presentation is

      1. reception of the DCF-77 VLF signal using a coil antenna, with enough power to feed a lock-in amplifier and extract phase and magnitude information. When the reference signal of the lock-in is referred to a local Cs primary standard, day/night ionosphere altitude variations are readily observed -- here using the carrier phase analysis,

      2. extraction of the time of flight through CDMA processing of the phase output from the lock-in amplifier, recorded on a (low frequency) oscilloscope, emphasizing the time resolution improvement of the phase modulation with respect to the amplitude modulation gained from the increased signal bandwidth,

      3. replace the lock-in amplifier with software-defined radio processing of signals recorded with a personal computer sound card or the analog to digital converter (RTL2832U) of a DVB-T receiver dongle,

      4. refer the second channel of the stereo sound card/DVB-T to a low-cost GPS 1-PPS time reference for local oscillator drift compensation, and hence measure the ionosphere altitutde variation through time of flight variation by comparing the phase-encoded cross-correlation peak position with the 1-PPS position, yielding results consistent with the lab-grade instrumentation.

    Although the whole processing chain is trivial, various issues making itspractical implementation challenging will be emphasized. Most significantly,the processing chain is very similar to those applied to [GPSsignals](https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/xcorr/), yet easier tograsp with the strong VLF signal. We aim at analyzing the time stability ofthe phase modulated signal -- allowing for sub-100 us timing resolution -- andcorrelated observed phase fluctuations with [ionospherealtitude](https://www.funkamateur.de/tl_files/downloads/hefte/2006/DG9WF_Iono_lang.pdf)

    Wireless mobile traffic lights are often used to secure construction siteswhen roads are partially blocked. Some day, when a pair of them was placedclose to our home, I set off to explore how they are working. In this talk, Iwill describe how I used a cheap RTL-SDR together with GQRX, Inspectrum, andGNU Radio to reverse engineer the modulation and frame format of differenttypes of wireless traffic lights. With some patience, I could also make somesense out of the bits. In particular, I was able to extract the signal stateand display it in a web interface, mirroring the traffic light. A closer lookat the frame format and the apparent absence of any authentication might leaveone with a bit of a worrying impression regarding the security of thosesystems.

    This talk will present a new method to estimate the bearing of a radiotransmitter with a mobile, single-antenna receiver, and its implementation ona software-defined radio (SDR) testbed. The bearing estimation method relieson the following principle: by considering the signal received at severalpoints along its trajectory, the receiver implicitly creates a virtual multi-antenna array (similarly to synthetic aperture radar systems) that can be usedto estimate the bearing of the radio transmitter. Virtual multi-antenna arrayshave two major differences with conventional multi-antenna arrays: 1) theposition and orientation of each antenna in the virtual array depends on themovement of the receiver and must be estimated; and 2) the local oscillator(LO) offset between transmitter and receiver adds a phase offset to the signalreceived by each “virtual” antenna, which must be estimated and compensatedfor. The first problem is solved by using an inertial measurement unit (IMU),which can provide the relative position and orientation of the receiver forshort time periods. The second problem is solved by expanding the signal modelthat is used in bearing estimation algorithms (such as MUSIC) to account forLO offset. The proposed system is implemented on a USRP-N210 SDR with anexternal high-end IMU and tested in an anechoic chamber. The SDRimplementation is a mixture of FPGA and software development, while some partsof the data are processed off-line. The results show that our method is indeedfeasible, with bearing estimation errors of only a few degrees. We thenpresent the first efforts of an implementation on a USRP-E310 SDR which has anintegrated, lower-quality IMU.

    Most SDR hardware nowadays includes an FPGA of sorts, but how to make use ofthem in an SDR application is often unclear for newcomers to the SDRecosystem. Even more daunting can be to take first steps into FPGA-land andstart writing code for your reprogrammable chips. We will talk about how anFPGA is actually useful for SDRs on an very basic level, and provide a verybasic introduction into how to use the RFNoC framework to start using (andmaybe learning) FPGAs.

    The following topics will be covered: \- How are FPGAs already available inmodern SDR hardware? \- Which tasks are FPGAs well suited to tackle? \- Whendo we move tasks to an FPGA, and when do we not? \- How can we enter the realmof FPGA development using the RFNoC framework?

During Google Summer of Code 2016, gr-inspector wasdeveloped to make these tasks more easy. The main purpose of the toolbox is toautomate as much of a receiving process as possible during runtime. Thecomponents of the toolbox include a energy detection block, automated down-mixing/filtering/decimation, resampling, automated modulation classification(AMC) and OFDM parameter estimation/synchronization. Also, a GUI is able todisplay the analysis results. In this talk, I will give information about thebackground of the toolbox, what it's capable of and how to use it.

    JESD204B is a industry standard for interfacing high-speed converters (ADC,DAC) to logic devices (FPGA, ASIC). This presentation will give a introductionto the JESD204B standard which is gaining increasing adoption in SDR solutionsto connect the RF-fronted device to the processing device.

    JESD204B is a industry standard for interfacing high-speed converters (ADC,DAC) to logic devices (FPGA, ASIC).

    Software-defined-radio solutions follow a trend of ever increasing channelbandwidth and diversity (e.g. MIMO). Another trend is the transition fromzero-IF to direct-IF, which bypasses the analog modulator and samples the fullspectrum up to the desired signal. Both of them require additional datathroughput rates which can reach the limits of more traditional interfaceslike CMOS or LVDS. The JESD204B standard has been designed to overcome theserestrictions and allow higher throughput data rates between the converter andthe logic device. It is as such not surprising that to accommodate theincreased data rate demands of such solutions JESD204B is often adopted, bothfor discrete as well as integrated RF designs.

    In addition to specifying the physical layer the JESD204B specification alsohas a protocol layer defining data mapping and encoding as well as standardmethods for commonly needed features like data integrity checks, multi-chipsynchronization and deterministic latency.

    This presentation will provide an introduction to the JESD204B standard in thecontext of software-defined-radio explaining how the different layers insidethe JESD204B standard interact, giving developers a understanding of how tosetup and configure a JESD204B system.

    The state of SDR, and free/open SDR in particular, is interesting. In somecases, SDR research and progress has been declared dead, implying that thereis nothing left to research or develop. Practical usage of SDR tells adifferent story, though, and users of SDR products run into all sorts ofissues every day.

    In this panel, we would like to discuss with the audience what the top issuesare that SDR frameworks need to solve in the near future -- be they technical,legal, political or anything else.

    What are the top 3 items that the realm of Software Defined Radio needs tofigure out? In this panel, we invite some experts as well as the entireaudience to discuss this question. We shall discuss technical challenges (ifthere are any) as well as legal and political challenges. Does free/opensoftware radio have any different questions to tackle? If we were to attend atechnical conference in the near future, what would be the most mind-blowingthing we could present? Will there be more, competing frameworks goingforward, or will they consolidate? These and many more questions shall be thetopic of this year's SDR panel.

    This talk will provide an overview of the evolution of OAI architecture tocater to distributed software radio systems, in particular thosecharacteristics of upcoming cellular networks.

    This talk was moved forwards 1 hour from its original timeslot (16:45).

    The evolution of radio communication networks will soon include by so-called“CloudRAN” technologies which refer to centralized radio-access infrastructuredeployed in data-centers. Although exhibiting important differences in thetype of processing they perform, the compute and storage architecture of thesedata-centers, as well as many of the software technologies, are very muchmodelled by those used by internet-based industries for information contentmanagement and distribution.

    The future network architecture is comprised of three segments, the so-calledfronthaul network, the CloudRAN data-centers and the main data-centers. Thefronthaul network links the radio nodes at the extremities with the CloudRAN.These interconnection networks are typically optical links over very largedistances (10-20 km) when the CloudRAN resides in the central office of anoperator. Various technologies are envisaged including analog (radio-over-fiber) PON (passive optical network), TDM and WDM PON and carrier gradeoptical Ethernet. Other solutions will also exist for indoor networks (e.g.airports, shopping malls, large administrations, private enterprise networks,etc.) using both optical and copper-based fronthaul networks.

    The software architecture of OpenAirInterface (OAI) is currently being evolvedto cater to these distributed processing environments. In particular theinfrastructure processing elements in OAI are being split at various places toallow them to be distributed between the central cloud processing units (RCC),the so-called radio-aggregation units (RAU) which perform centralized signalprocessing and switching and the network of remote-radio units (RRU). OAI nowcomprises two such processing splits which will be detailed along withexamples of how to build simple ethernet-based RRU with low-cost commodityradio equipment (e.g. USRP B2x0, LimeSDR, etc.) and embedded PCs or ARM-basedcomputers. In addition, The current architecture for deploying OAI in a data-center environment will be described.

    A short live demonstration of networked-signal processing for 4G will beprovided comprising a USRP-based RRU running on an UPBoard, an ethernetfronthaul and a mini radio-cloud-center housing the access protocol stack anda small core network.

    Working with Gerber files today is a task done by CAM personnel usingextremely expensive and proprietary software. Until today no easy way existsto edit Gerber files through an API. What only few know is that libgerbv fromthe Geda project has proper support to not only show but also to edit Gerberfiles.

    Using the Ruby bindings for libgerbv it is now possible to edit Gerber filesthrough a simple API.

    Working with Gerber files within the PCB manufacturing process takes a largechunk of the work as a lot of tasks like panelization are done directly withinthese files. However, until today there is no easy or an open source way towork with these files.

    The Geda Team has done a great job with their Gerbv software as it is usedworldwide to check Gerber files for correctness before production. What mostpeople do not know is that libgerbv, which is used under the hood, is alsocapable of editing Gerber files. One of the reasons might be, that libgerbv isnot accessible by most software engineers. To overcome this we, i.e. AISLER,have developed a simple Ruby binding for libgerbv. Using the API it ispossible to load, edit and save Gerber files with just a few lines of code.Possible use cases are panelization, adding fiducials, receiving designinformation such as drill count and much more.

    Right now the libgerbv ruby bindings (which will probably get some more catchyname later) are used within our own PCB manufacturing process athttps://go.aisler.net. They'll be published during FOSDEM 2017.

    Traditionally, the goal of digital hardware design has been to produce anASIC. Ideally one which works perfectly after the first tapeout. Tailoredtowards this goal are our development and testing processes: strictlyfollowing a V-model with separated development and verification teams, longdesign iterations and code which, once it's known to work, is never touchedagain. For people coming from the software world, this development approachlooks arcane. Where are all the sprints, the agile methods, the quickiterations?

    With FPGAs being on the rise and available in more and more cloud data centersand possibly bundled with our next Intel processor, we finally get the chanceto cheaply make mistakes in digital hardware designs: no more wasted tapeouts,just a new flashing of the FPGA is necessary to fix a bug.

    Join me in this talk for a look at development processes and tools. Where canwe build bridges between the software and hardware development world, andwhere do we have fundamentally different needs?

    Footwork is an experimental KiCAD footprint (text) editor written in Racket.Footwork takes advantage of Lisp's code-data equivalence to offer a uniqueapproach to PCB design: KiCAD's footprint format becomes a domain specificlanguage embedded in the Racket programming language.

    Footwork's interface is text first allowing users to make arbitrary edits:their requirements need not be fully anticipated by the user interface. Theusers still immediately see the effects of their edits through a graphicalpreview but can use a fully featured general purpose programming languages togenerate and modify footprints.

    Traditional (mouse based) manipulation is being added as calls to scripting.Most interestingly, Racket's Rosette language, an interface to SMT solvers,offers the opportunity to make use of cutting edge techniques in programmingsynthesis for design automation.

    GNOME Recipe App is all about food. We all love food. We want the recipe appto be community driven. GNOME people all over the world will be entering theirfavourite recipes and also they will be able to cook delicious things usingthe GNOME recipes.

    This is not a new idea. Looking all the way back to 2007, the idea of a GNOMEcook book was already around (https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeCookbook). For onereason or another, we never quite got there. But the idea has stuck around.With the upcoming 20th birthday of GNOME next year, we thought that we shouldmake another attempt at this app, maybe as a birthday gift to all of us. Oncewe release the app, we will start to collect the content and print as acookbook.

    My talk will be shortly about how we decided to build the GNOME Recipe App asa community, how i started to work on mock-ups, how Jakub Steiner (design)designed them based on my mock-ups and how Matthias Clasen (engineering)implemented them.

    My real motivation with this talk to explain how we had fun while working onthe app and encourage designers to contribute open source projects more.

    You can see the demo video and landing page design on the files screen. Plusyou can also visit our wiki page for more details.(https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Potential/Recipe%20App)

    I also want to talk about connecting the user experience, the technicalrequirements and the business requirements together is important in productdiscovery and development process. And for this, being a good communicatorbetween teams in an organization is a key to make sure that everybody is onthe same page. Many designers divides up building a product into two distinctparts – design and development. There is always some technical questions I’mreceiving from Matthias that can heavily influence my design decisions. Thosequestions should be asked and addressed as early as possible by talking withMatthias and Jakub. Recipe app starts and continues with discussions betweendesign and engineering.  In terms of interaction, visual design and implementation, details revealthemselves as the product is being built. Instead of handing off pixel-perfectdesigns to the team, it is far more better to design alongside them as webuild it.

    We will keep developing our app!

    Goals

      1. I want to see all delicious food recipes from all over the world.  2. I want to add recipes from my mum, grandmother  3. I want to select my favourite recipes for later use  4. I want to see what ingredients are needed for the recipe  5. I want to see ingredients photo and explanations in the ingredients page from A to Z  6. I want to keep track of what ingredients you’ve added and steps you’ve completed in each recipe by checking what you’ve done. I want to follow the cooking process from the beginning stage to the end stage. For example which stage I’m at now. Preparing the ingredients, which ingredients are put into the bowl… All things need to be checked when it’s completed. Timer should start when it is in the oven. preparation made simple with step-by-step instructions  7. If I’m following a person I like, I want to see the other recipes he cooked, other recipes he favourited, his origin, his favourite foods (mentioning it by country or by ingredients)  8. On the landing page I should see the recipes that matches the countries I choose, ingredients I choose and my favourites and the people I’m following  9. Want to print the recipes so I can put them on my fridge  10. Make easy recipe adjustments with in substutions and conversions within each recipe

    Non-Goals

      1. We won’t build a web site. It will be only a GNOME app for GNOME community  2. There won’t be recipes from cookbooks (Copyright issues).

    Bareos (Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced) is a reliable, cross-networkopen source software for backup, archiving and recovery of data for all well-established operating systems. Emerged from the Bacula Project in 2010, Bareoswas and is actively developed as a fork and enriched with lots of newfeatures. After a short introduction about the Bareos architecture andterminology, this session will introduce how to extend Bareos with Pluginswritten in Python.

    Using plugins makes it possible to extend the Bareos functionality. Thisallows to backup and restore in an application specific and more flexible anddynamic way than normal file backup. Use cases include database backups,agentless virtual machine backups or LDAP backups. Using Python makes this alot easier, and with its large library for connectivity and API access it ispossible to address a wide range of applications.

    Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) is a bare metal Disaster Recovery tool that can saveyou hours (and sometimes days) to recover a system from scratch in case offailure. However, for us developers before making a new release it is a realnightmare to test all the different Linux distributions in combination withall the known workflows that ReaR provides. It used to be a manual process oftesting the recovery, but we are in progress to automate the whole process forsome workflows. We will explain the internals of how we do automated testingand we will give a live demo as well.

    Bareos (Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced) is a reliable, cross-networkopen source software for backup and recovery of data for a large set ofoperating systems (Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS). Bareos offers a lot of toolsfor user interaction. The best known tool is the bconsole, offering a commandline interface. While it offers a lot of functions and can also be scripted,the Bareos JSON backend is much easier parse-able, especially when using thebareos-python module.

    This presentation will show, how Bareos can be scripted. It will give aoverview about the existing tools (bconsole, bls, bscan, bareos-dir, ...),with special focus to the Bareos Console. It will show the Bareos Consolefeature, like commands, ACLs, JSON backend and scripting abilities. Especiallyfor the JSON backend, we show how this can be accessed by the python-bareosmodule.

    To get some initial basic understanding how Relax-and-Recover works you willuse it yourself on two virtual machines on your laptop.

    On the first virtual machine Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) will be installed andused to prepare that machine for disaster recovery.

    The second virtual machine is the replacement machine that is used fordisaster recovery of the first virtual machine.

    Preconditions for this workshop:

    To actively participate you need a sufficiently powerful laptop it that isready-to-use prepared as follows:

      * An NFS server runs on the laptop that exports a directory in "rw" mode.

      * Two simple virtual machines are running on the laptop:

        * x86/x86_64 with BIOS (no UEFI)    * hardware virtualization (no paravirtualization)    * a single virtual 20GB harddisk (IDE disk)    * a usual virtual CDROM drive (IDE CDROM)    * a single usual virtual network interface card (no special driver/firmware)  * A small and simple Linux system is running on the first virtual machine that is installed in a single ext3/ext4 filesystem with GRUB/GRUB2 as bootloader.

      * The Linux system running on the first virtual machine can access the NFS server that runs directly on the laptop.

      * A second "empty" virtual machine without an operating system that is identical as the first one (BIOS, same 20GB harddisk, CDROM, same NIC).

      * Preferably a recent ReaR version is installed on the Linux system that is running on the first virtual machine

    What will be done step by step:

    If not already done Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) will be installed on the Linuxsystem that is running on the first virtual machine.

    ReaR will be set up (configured) for disaster recovery.

    By running "rear mkbackup" on the first virtual machine one gets on the NFSserver a backup.tar.gz and a rear-hostname.iso.

    The first virtual machine is shut down to simulate a disaster happened.

    The second virtual machine is booted from the rear-hostname.iso via CDROM.

    Now the special ReaR rescue/recovery system runs on the second virtual machineand by running "rear recover" therein one gets on the second virtual machinethe system re-created as it had been before on the first virtual machine.

    Full backups of large storage devices are expensive, slow, and waste a lot ofspace. Incremental and differential backups are an oft-requested feature invirtualization stacks to help eliminate the redundant copying of backup data.

    This presentation will cover recent developments in related delta-backuptechnologies, covering incremental and differential backups, image fleecing,dirty bitmap management, and different paradigms of consuming this data toproduce reliable backups both through QEMU as an agent or via an externalbackup appliance.

    # Style

    This talk will cover the incremental backup functionality in QEMU anddevelopments since its first introduction in 2015.

    The talk is intended to be a fairly light-weight, quick trip through thefeature; explaining the mechanics behind both the implementation and the API.I do not intend to cover in incredible detail the algorithmic minutiae ofincremental backup techniques, but 'dirty bitmaps' as a fundamental technologyenabling the technique will feature quite heavily. A theme of the talk will behow these features were implemented using targeted modifications to existingstable API to unlock rich functionality while maintaining backwardscompatibility -- and the difficulties faced while doing so in a diverse opensource environment. Current/Future developments are intended to be a highlightof the talk.

    # Audience

    First and foremost, students who are interested in how large-scale projectstackle problems and would like some insight to how components in "the cloud"actually manage data on a technical level would find this talk interesting. Atthe very least, hopefully they find it entertaining.

    Secondly, any developers or hobbyists who rely on virtualization in theirworkflow, but may not be heavily invested or well-versed in QEMU/KVM/libvirtet al specifically could benefit from an expanded knowledge of how this FOSSvirtualization stack manages data. These users may be keen to gain insightinto newer, more flexible storage and backup options.

    Third, Upper-layer stack developers or users who script against upper-layervirtualization stack components may be interested to hear what we're cookingup -- this includes libvirt, virsh, openstack, oVirt or any projects thatcount these projects as dependencies.

    And lastly, anyone who has a keen appreciation for bad puns on slide captionsmight enjoy stopping by.

    # Takeaways

    Attendees can expect to leave with a basic outline of the storage managementsolutions as they exist in FOSS virtualization today, and how we'd like toimprove on them. With a copy of the slides and footnotes, attendees will bewell equipped to author power-user scripts that take advantage of someadvanced functionality in QEMU-kvm today that may help them eke out moremileage from their existing FOSS virtualization stack. The talk will covergeneral design, usage, current caveats and expected next steps for relatedbackup features; this will hopefully provide generally relevant informationfor anyone interested in or contributing to the field in general.

    An important aspect of humane interfaces is meeting the needs of a variety ofpeople. They all have different skills, restrictions and whims. How do youfigure out what exactly those are?

    In this presentation I’ll talk about how I used user interviews and personasfor that purpose, using them as tools for discussions and implementation ofPublic Transportation in GNOME Maps. I'll talk about how I interviewed peoplefrom both cities and countryside, from both Brazil and Sweden, and how theirinsights challanged my own perceptions about what people need from a publictransportation UI.

    Numerous works of architecture, furniture, sculptures, illustrations andtypography were made during the 1920s by a modernistic style called theAmsterdamse School. A lot of these works are not easily accessible and, eventhough preservation efforts are being taken, many are deteriorating over time.This talk will elaborate on how FOSS design and typographic tools weredeveloped and used to digitise and extend a century old font under an OFL.

    To aid the effort of preserving and reuse minimalistic – though often playful– designs from the early 20th century, Stichting z25.org ran a project wherean sculpted incomplete typeface was digitised and made available as a font.The focus of this case study was on typographic design, FOSS development andco-funding.

    This project used contemporary cultural entrepreneurship by combiningcrowdfunding and public funding to finance this project. As a side-effect, thecrowdfunding campaign contributed to local awareness about the existingcultural heritage and more insight to the amount of work required fortypographical designs.

    After completing a study of the original artist's works, a pipeline of severalFOSS design tools was set up to meet this challenge. Graphviz was used tocategorise and divide the design workload in infographics which also showcharacter interdependencies. Additionally, we show how design work andcollaboration can be managed more in Agile environments. The individual glyphdesigns were done in Inkscape and the font files were generated by usingFontForge.

    FontForge offers sharing guides (lines supporting and accelerating the designprocess) amongst glyph designs, however Inkscape has no such facility as theindividual SVG files are not synchronised for this. We developed a tool inPython to selectively synchronise guides.

    In this presentation, z25.org will talk you through their adventure offunding, developing, digitising, designing and sharing. The result is apreserved and revitalised typeface called Neude that lay dormant for over ahundred years on impressive statues in the former post office in Utrecht, theNetherlands.

    Open discussion about the design feedback process, gathering expectations andguidelines from different open source communities.

    Every Open Source project is different, every developer and designer isdifferent so hoping that this session would provide a magic answer to ourquestions is not realistic. Its purpose is to open the discussion and try togather examples from different communities in the search of drawing someguidelines.

    In Open Source, the hardest part is to know when a design iteration shouldstop: after a certain amount of time, after a certain amount of votes, etc.Since there are no real/accountable stakeholders/decision-makers and themajority of decisions are done with voting, it can be hard for a designer toknow which voices should be listened when iterating. Also, design is notreally like code, so it can be harder to do partial work and just let anotherdesigner continue it. Sometimes things need to be redone from scratch (becauseof style differences, vision, approach, tools, etc.)

    The purpose of giving and receiving feedback in open source should maximizethe input all parties receive, having in mind their interests, availability,experience, commitment, etc.

    Some questions we could ask: \- What can be done when we feel there is noconsensus between designer and community or even between community members? \-What are the motives for proposing the design work and how much work does itinvolve? \- Should something be accepted just because it's the only proposal?Do we have the luxury to refuse design work? \- Should the same rules as incode review be applied? \- How do we better match designers and communities interms of style? \- Should people from outside the community be involved in thefeedback process? \- Are community members the target or representatives fortheir users?

    Meeting everyone's expectations needs a better communication and understandingof the topic and that's what this session tries to achieve.

    Designers are not allergic to open source – it often is just quite difficultand frustrating to get involved. Gladly there are some easy methods to make UX& UI folks feel welcome and get them contributing! :) This talk will show themethods we use at Nextcloud – which successfully helped us build an active andwelcoming design team.

    Some of these methods include: \- Describe clearly what your project does \-Being welcoming to designers \- Involving design from the start \- Usingdesign tags in the issue tracker \- Have an easy landing page to get involved\- Cultivating a culture of design-driven decisions \- and more! :)

    Open source software has always been engineering driven. Most of the peoplebuilding open source software are engineers with major turn on for featuresand more features which kind of explains how a lot of open source projectshave rich and extremely important features but are a pain to see or work with.This talk aims to deal with this problem of designing in the open which isoften neglected. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc. can actually become an arenafor usability testing and give extremely promising output only if it followsan effective design process. This talk is also a practical guide for buddingdesigners to get started with open source software.

    We know the expression ‘Open Source’; what about ‘Open Design’? How could wedefine ‘Open Design’? Design creative process is not disclosed. The secrecyaround it is of the utmost importance in order to prevent the originalcreations from being stolen. The different stages of the process and thetechniques used are only known by those involved in the design. How could wecall this stance into question and open the creative process? This talk willpresent existing initiatives and thoughts to make Graphic Design and OpenFonts fields more available to the public.

    First I will introduce graphic designers and typographers who open theirprocess: why do they share their practice? why is it interesting? how and whyis it useful? I will talk about originality and copy: we should not be afraidof copying. Moreover copying can be an opportunity to improve the originaldesign. About Mozilla rebranding: I will point out some suggestions to furtherthat initiative. How could designers take part and get committed? Finally Iwill give designers food for thought to defend their work, explain andcommunicate it, and better collaborate with their team and people who are notdesigners.

    Slides available at https://belenbarrospena.github.io/fosdem2017

    The decision of creating a jobs board as part of the Open Source Designproject was no doubt an excellent one. Our conversations during the first OpenSource Design devroom showed that a place to match designers with FOSSprojects was sorely needed. At November 19th, the jobs board has received 53submissions. I consider this a success, given our limited reach and the smallsize of the Open Source Design initiative.

    Going through the content of those 53 submissions shows a clear pattern: theoverwhelming majority are looking for graphic designers, and many of them areasking for a project logo.

    Although graphic design is absolutely fundamental to software, and brandingelements such as logos help projects develop and strengthen their identity,user-centered design is much more than that, as the content of our devroomsillustrate. It is also important to understand that good graphic design doesnot exist in isolation: it is embedded within the work of other user-centereddesign disciplines and concerns.

    User research, information architecture, interaction design and contentstrategy can make valuable contributions to FOSS projects. The question is,how? What needs to change for FOSS projects to identify the need of aninformation architect or a user researcher? Is it just about buildingknowledge and awareness about these branches of design? Or do thesedisciplines require some fundamental changes to the way contributions happen?

    This talk is more about questions than answers. It will provide a briefintroduction to the different "layers" of the user-centered design process asoutlined by Jesse James Garrett(http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf), and will pose some questionsabout how to incorporate them into FOSS projects.

    Finding the answers to those questions is one of the reasons why we need theOpen Source Design community.

    Getting HCI MSc students involved in open source software!

    Whats not to like!

    I've had agreement from a university in London to propose a number open sourcesoftware projects to a HCI masters programme for studnets to carry outusability evaluations as part of their MSc in HCI programme.

    I would like to do a short 10 maybe 15 mins proposal to members of establishedopen source projects which would be able to take the feedback from "the top2%" of student evaluations and incorporate them into their software.

    I would outline what the criteria for the projects would be (still to bedecided), and also what the students would do for the project and how theywould send the recommendations to them.

    Essentially, it's a gathering of interest exercise. It'll be super quick.Please accept me!

    I'd be happy to do this at the end of the day combined with something else ifnecessary.

    UX Design is often understood as creating an interface and testing if it isusable. But it can also include finding out what would be useful and servesusers’ needs.

    Methods to analyze user needs exits, however, they may assume a lot ofresources or don’t consider community driven work.

    We want to demonstrate methods we used for Wikidata and Mediawiki to *research user needs * use the findings to improve our software

    We want to particularly highlight

      * How to do this with few resources  * How to involve an open source community  * How to involve team members who are not designers

    We hope to enable participants of the session to use the methods in theirprojects and communities and encourage to develop the methods further.

    A fundamental aspect of the Genode OS project always was the support forvarious kernels as back-end. It remarkably raised testing versatility andprovided a high flexibility to users and developers. But supporting the GenodeAPI on self-contained third-party kernels is sometimes also accompanied withdeficiencies, redundancies, or work-arounds. To also have the option of abasic kernel without such compromises, the custom Genode kernel was developed.Its main distinguishing mark may be that it not only trusts the Genode Core-component but even more is a mere library to it. The implications of this newdesign and other characteristics of the custom Genode kernel, such asscheduling, capabilities, and ARM virtualization, are discussed in thislecture.

    Redox is an attempt to make a complete, fully-functioning, general-purposeoperating system with a focus on safety, freedom, reliability, correctness,and pragmatism.

    So how do we get there? By keeping the kernel minimal, both in terms ofsyscalls and in terms of size. By writing the code in Rust, a modern, memory-safe and type-safe systems programming language. By maintaining minimalprivileges, through a general capability-based system.

    Redox is an ambitious project, but it already runs on real hardware. Let'stake a look.

    Embedded system development is a complex area in which the developers need tohave a deep understanding of the underlying hardware with its configurationsand interfaces, and one of the solutions to reduce this complexity is toutilize an operating system. This talk will introduce F9 microkernel aimed atlow resources embedded systems powered by ARM Cortex-M microprocessors,allowing to perform real-time activities while keeping the drivers and theapplication isolated by a secure layer.

    F9 microkernel proved itself extremely small and simple to use while stillmaintaining the security of the system regarding the temporal constraints witha trusted computing base (TCB) as small as 3kLoC, which is important forsafety, security and reliability in mission-critical embedded systems. Thistalk will also present the prototype at its early stages built to experimentwith the idea of third-generation microkernels heavily inspired by seL4 forresource-constrained devices with fairly strong memory protection.

    Virtualization is one aspect of our everyday life where multiserver operatingsystems can shine. Given the right underlying architecture, one gets robustand fine-grained virtualization with little effort and code. Achieving thesame on conventional monolithic systems requires careful and invasive changesto the whole system, and the security merely depends on the implementation athand.

    This talk describes and demos how both fine- and coarse-grained virtualizationis implemented on the Hurd, and how virtualization helps users gain freedom#0, i.e. the freedom to shape her computation environment anyway she wants.

    HelenOS is a portable microkernel-based multiserver operating system designedand implemented from scratch. It decomposes key operating system functionalitysuch as file systems, networking, device drivers and graphical user interfaceinto a collection of fine-grained user space components that interact witheach other via message passing. HelenOS does not aim to be a clone of anyexisting operating system and trades compatibility with legacy APIs forcleaner design. Most of HelenOS components have been made to orderspecifically for HelenOS so that its essential parts can stay free of gluecode, franken-components and the maintenance burden incurred by them. In thistalk I will do the annual HelenOS project update.

    The virtual file system (switch) is an instrinsic element of traditionaloperating systems and the majority of alternative OSes alike. For the mostpart, this is caused by existing applications that depend on the fileabstraction and to some extent on a global view on system resources. Incontrast, component-based OSes with strong security ambitions strive to applythe principle of least authority and shun one global view on the system. Thiswas the starting for the VFS developments for Genode. The talk will presentour design considerations and the current state of the VFS in Genode as acomponent and capability-based microkernel operating system.

    I wrote inet (the TCP/IP stack on MINIX) for two reasons: I like to come upwith my own designs for everything and, most of all, I had to impress AndyTanenbaum enough to become a Ph.D. student. Inet had to fit in with MINIX. Inparticular, it had to live with minimal changes to the MINIX code base. At thesame time, there were quite a few areas where I felt sockets and the BSDTCP/IP implementation were wrong.

    In hindsight, there is a lot that I did not know and got wrong. I this talk, Iwill look at how inet follows the structure of MINIX, what works, and whatwent wrong.

    we are modifying Nova kernel to make it support temporal redundancy for userprocesses running Genode components. Every time a process releases the CPU, wemanage to restart it from its last starting point and re-run the same portionof the process code. An practical application of this could be animplementation of a fault tolerant system. At the end of the two executions,one may compare their memory footprints to detect an eventual fault due forexample to SEU. We are also interested in the performance penalty this wouldinduce on the overall systems compared to existing redundancy models. In thistalk, we will present how Genode components performances are impacted by thistype of redundancy. Possible choices and remaining challenges for extendingthis model for multiprocessor environment will also be discussed.

    FreedomBox is a consumer device that aims to facilitate free communicationamong people, safely and securely, in a world where our fundamental rights areunder grave threat. FreedomBox will put in people's own hands and under theirown control encrypted voice and text communication, anonymous publishing,social networking, media sharing, and (micro)blogging. It is built on top ofDebian and is currently available for several single board computers.

    This talk is aimed at introducing FreedomBox, its goals, current status andfuture plans. It is also a call for help.

    Decentralization of the Internet

    Basic human communication is getting more and more online. Many of us probablyalready communicate more on the Internet than offline. The communication mediaare often controlled by few corporate entities who hold immense power. Thispower that they continue to accumulate is often abused to the determent oftheir users. Instead of building and relying such centralized entities, weneed to build an Internet that is more decentralized and controlled by thepeople using it.

    FreedomBox

    Most people often believe that there is no alternative to using centralizedservices like Gmail and Facebook. A global network of volunteers are buildingsoftware that will put back control of communications back into people'shands. In many areas, such software exists but is not easy to use. FreedomBoxproject aims to build a consumer device that brings these decentralizedtechnologies together for easy usage and maintenance by typical users.

    Ruben Lubbes has been working with and participating in the project for years,mainly working on translations, product development and persona's.

    OpenWISP2 is a simple web app composed of several reusable python librariesand django apps. Having learnt from the experience with OpenWISP1, the newversion of the controller has been redesigned to be more flexible, reusable,modularly built and easier to deploy.

    Its goal is to make it easier to maintain a network of devices based onOpenWRT/LEDE.

    Current features

      * configuration management for embedded devices supporting different firmwares: OpenWRT/LEDE and OpenWISP Firmware  * support for additional firmware can be added by specifying custom backends  * configuration editor based on JSON-Schema editor  * advanced edit mode: edit NetJSON DeviceConfiguration objects for maximum flexibility  * configuration templates: reduce repetition to the minimum  * configuration context: reference ansible-like variables in the configuration  * simple HTTP resources: allow devices to automatically download configuration updates  * VPN management: easily create VPN servers and clients

    Project goals

      * automate configuration management for embedded devices  * allow to minimize repetition by using templates  * make it easy to integrate in larger django projects to improve reusability  * make it easy to extend its models by providing abstract models  * provide ways to support more firmwares by adding custom backends  * keep the core as simple as possible  * provide ways to extend the default behaviour  * encourage new features to be published as extensions

    It is probably unnecessary to explain the perils of a GAFAM centralized web inthis devroom. But we offer the idea that recentralizing one's data into apersonal cloud allows for MORE than only privacy.

    In today's web our data are kept into silos. Several companies each own afragment of one's digital identity. Google has the emails, Facebook hasfriends pictures, mobile providers have a timeline of my location, my eventsare so mixed up.

    As FOSS developer, it is our responsibility to provide an open-sourcealternative to these. But convincing friends and families of the importance ofit is not easy, an it is not possible to replace a network-effect system byjust doing an open source alternative.

    We posit a possible first step is to move (or at least copy) our data from thecloud, aka someone's else computer, back to one's computer. And then to useall this data comming from different sources to create mashups that siloscannot provide.

    In this talk, we will create one such use case, from retrieving some data froma provider, mashing it up against some of user's data and providing a newusage. This app is made as a simple web app, installable.

    One of the main issue with centralized internet services is the commercialexploitation of people private datas, and the relative lack of security ofthose data against states actors among others. Yet, being self hosted andusing smaller provider do not automatically grant protection, and few peopledo have a concrete idea of what steps are needed to efficiently protect theprivacy of others when hosting services, inspired by the policy of Mozilla,riseup and several others groups trying to do the right things

    This talk will mostly speak of the steps required for respecting privacy, witha focus on privacy beyond "The NSA is trying to catch me", showing how eventhe best intentions do result in problem for some users, and how sysadmins andactivists can set their systems to protect users without burdening them, andhow things are most often more subtle than we think, in the context of hostingservices.

    Surveillance: the case for personal Cloud and against GAFAMs

    The concept of Personal Cloud

    Demonstrating a personal cloud instance and its innovative usage.

    Most of the Western population now uses 3 different kinds of computers: PCs,smartphones and Cloud services. Where is the room for Open Source and FreeSoftware in this new world? Software freedom is possible on the PC side, it'salready quite challenged on the smartphone world, and too little is being doneon the Cloud side. A lot of Cloud services run on open source software, butoffer in the end proprietary services that centralize user data. As EdwardSnowden's revelations have demonstrated, all of this makes mass surveillanceeconomically possible.

    What do we do as a community to avoid mass surveillance? What alternative dowe build?

    One possibility is the Personal Cloud movement, where a server (self-hosted ornot) runs a platforms that enables personal data collection through connectorsin order to run innovative apps relying on that personal data.

    During this short presentation, we'll see how data centralization leads tomass surveillance and how a personal cloud works.

    The internet started as a decentralized network based on Open Standards. Backthen everybody could set up his own web server, mail server or news server andcommunicate with the rest of the world. The last years we saw, that for manyusers the internet was reduced to a few centralized services used to connectwith their friends, to communicate and to store and share all kind of data.Nextcloud wants counteract this development for people who want to store, syncand share their data. It provides a cloud platform based on Open Standards andFree Software. To connect the nodes of self-hosted cloud platforms, Nextcloudis the driving force behind the concept of Cloud Federation. The aim is toprovide a Open Standard to share data across multiple cloud servers. At themoment this protocol is not only implemented by Nextcloud but also by Pydioand ownCloud. Together with many partners, Nextcloud works on formalizing theprotocols to create a real standard. This talk want to discuss how to restorea free, decentralized and open internet in the area of data sync and share.

The last years we saw, that for manyusers the internet was reduced to a few centralized services used to connectwith their friends, to communicate and to store and share all kind of data.This lecture looks at this development from the perspective of a cloudplatform which enables people to store, share and sync all kind of data. Inthis area we saw already the last years a strong push to more decentralizedsolution, developed as Free Software. This was a important step in the rightdirection, but at the same time it created a new problem. Everybody who set uphis own cloud platform can only collaborate with users on the same server. Itbecome obvious that we need a way to connect all this clouds again. Like withemail, for example, it shouldn't make a difference if you communicate withsomeone on the same server or not. In order to build this bridge, a conceptcalled Cloud Federation was introduced. The aim is to provide a Open Standardto share data across multiple cloud servers. At the moment this protocolconnects all Nextcloud, Pydio and ownCloud users. Today Nextcloud is thedriving force behind this development and work actively with many partners onformalizing the protocol in order to create a real Open Standard.

    The success of the decentralised internet depends on robust building blocksfor decentralised identity, reputation and communication in general. We'lllook at how Matrix.org (an open standard for decentralised communication) isattacking these problems - both now and in the future.

    Matrix is an open source project that publishes a standard and reference FOSSimplementations for decentralised communication, primarily focusing ondefragmenting all the various communication silos (messaging, VoIP, IoT etc)that users are trapped in today. We believe that no single company or entityshould ever have ownership or control a user's conversations - only the userthemselves should have control.

    In Matrix today rooms are replicated over all the servers which participate ina given conversation, decentralising by default similarly to Git orblockchain. Unlike other protocols, rooms have no single point of control on agiven domain or entity and conversation history is shared equally over allparticipants. However, user accounts themselves are currently bound to asingle 'home server', meaning that users are currently tied to a singleservice provider, similarly to email or XMPP.

    In this talk, we'll discuss Matrix's plans to decentralise accounts too -letting users share their account data across whatever sets of servers theytrust; providing account portability as a matter of course. We'll also discussthe related topic of decentralised identity - how to track how emailaddresses, phone numbers and other identifiers map to a given matrix user...without maintaining a centralised ID mapping database.

    Finally, we'll explore the critical topic of decentralised reputation. Anydecentralised system, whether it's Matrix, Email, XMPP, blockchain etc needs away of tracking the relative reputation of the participants in the system inorder to let users filter undesirable content. We see this as the singlebiggest challenge remaining for Matrix, and one that is vital to the internetat large - helping users self-curate the content they consume and breakingfree of the echo-chamber effect of centralised services. We'll talk about theoptions we've been looking at with Matrix, and issue a call to arms for thewhole community to work on solving this problem.

    Big data companies (aka GAFAM) have centralized our services, our data and ourdigital lives. Over the last two years, the French non-profit organizationFramasoft has been demonstrating that FLOSS can be used as an ethical anduser-respecting alternative to widespread services such as Dropbox, Skype,Facebook, Google Agenda, or even Minecraft. Time has now come to share thisexperience so that it can spread into a network of data-friendly and user-respectful service hosters.

    2016 is a milestone: Google Apple Facebook Amazon and Microsoft (also known asGAFAM) are now ranked as the 5 largest companies by market capitalization inthe USA. Big Data has become more important and powerful than Big Oil or BigPharma. Web centralization, profiling advertisement, government enablement tocarry out mass-surveillance, shrinking diversity and innovation, and evenbevahioural hijacking: here are only a few of the numerous issues that arisewith these huge centralizede powers

    Even though a wider audience is becoming aware of these issues, their answeris always the same: "What else can I use?"

    Framasoft is a small French non-profit association whose aim is to promoteFree-Libre software and culture to the general public through practicalprojects: a Free-Libre software directory, a user-friendly USB stick filledwith portable FLOSS, a publishing house for Free-Libre books… In October 2014,we made public this impossible challenge: over the next 3 years, we wouldprovide Mr. and Mrs. Everyone with more than 30 alternatives to the main GAFAMservices, all based upon Free-Libre and Open-Source softwares while respectingthe users privacy. We aimed at a triple goal : to inform the general audienceof the stakes, to provide viable alternative as a proof of concept tomainstream users, and to spread this experience by promoting self-hosting andhelping other data-friendly services hosters to grow.

    More than two years later, a wider audience is being aware of the data-centralization issues. We are on track to win our bet since only a fewservices remain to be launched. We are currently initiating CHATONS, a networkbringing together hosters who respect privacy and provide ethical services.

    Here is the story of what we did and how we did it. We would be thrilled ifour experience could be useful to non-French speaking projects andcommunities.

    The goal of the project is to allow average, tech-oriented user to run theirown server applications, without worrying about maintaining a server. Theultimate aim is to achieve greater decentralization of federated services,such as social networking, file sharing, blog or email, on the net.

    While many people are looking at containers as a way to run massiveapplications, automatically scaling to millions of users, Puffin allowsrunning many independent personal lightweight applications on a singlephysical machine.

    The first part of the project is a specialized application catalog for Docker,with easy to use interface à la app store, that can be easily run on apersonal server. The second part is a common hosting platform which allowsrunning limited number of applications for free.

    During the presentation I will introduce the ideas behind the project and showa demo.

    The difference between Puffin and other container management and hostingservices such as Docker Cloud or Rancher, is that the applications are curatedto achieve optimal efficiency on a small scale and the interface is morefriendly towards an average computer user. Docker was chosen as containertechnology due to its popularity - more and more web applications areproviding Dockerfile or even docker-compose.yml themselves, so it's not verydifficult to adapt them to include in the package repository.

    Putting multiple containers on a single machine to reduce hosting costsimplies multi-tenancy. Although Docker is not fully secure against accessinghost system from a container, I believe the situation will improve in thefuture or alternatively another container technology will be used for Puffin.

    In order to help people keeping control over personal data, the Caliopenproject intend to associate with each element of it's user interface,including messages, a "Privacy index" showing as precisely as possible howmuch that element is at risk of being publicly exposed. We will expose hereour problems and leads.

    The confidentiality of correspondence has been historically characterized byletter exchanges. Think of the stamped royal letter protected with a wax seal.Everyone knows that a letter mailed in a glued envelope is more private than astandard postcard. This confidentiality with easily-understood privacyindicators has disappeared with the advent of digital correspondence.

    In order to offer the public a better control over their private life,Caliopen proposes to associate a "privacy index" indicator to each element ofit's interface. The user will be able to easily improve the level indicated bythis index and thus be encouraged to better protect themselves and theircontacts.

    In order to do so, we have to define precise metrics to calculate thoseindices, that rely as much on technical data (protocol used, encryption...)than on human behaviour. We intend to present how much ambitious this is, thedifficulties we face, and the leads we follow to realize that particular goal.

    Free Software on the desktop was cool in the 2000s, but nowadays, we needFLOSS as a Service. If you go to dropbox, you signup with your email/password,boom, you get your cloud. If you go to Nextcloud.com, the call to action is"download". We'll never reach the 99%, we need a signup button on every freesoftware landing page. libre.sh is paving the way toward that direction. Thefirst step is to have an infrastructure to orchestrate these softwares.

    During this presentation, I'll show you how we leverage the power of docker tomanage hundreds of containers that deliver FLOSS as a Service for the 99%.I'll quickly explain why we choose docker. Then, I'll dive into showing, live,how to setup a full server with:

      * HAProxy with let's encrypt  * Rocket.Chat  * GitLab  * ELK (for log collection)

    And all in less than 20 minutes. So then, you have no excuses to not host freesoftware for you and/or your organization :)

    libre.sh in numbers:

      * installed on 5 servers (4 different organizations) (that I know)  * running hundreds of containers  * offering 24 different applications (chat, git, cloud, mail...)  * with a wide range of different stacks (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, PHP, Ruby, NodeJS...)  * and 4 modules (log collection, monitoring, backups, proxy)  * developped since 2 years

    MicroPython is a FOSS implementation of Python 3 optimised to run on amicrocontroller with MHz and tens or hundreds of Kbytes of RAM. I will presentMicroPython in terms of hardware and software, including some boards withnetwork access, like WiFi, Bluetooth and LoRa. But even with these hardwareconstraints, scientific MicroPython is already available and practical, to beshown from the perspective of users and developers.

    MicroPython is a implementation of Python 3 optimised to run on amicrocontroller, created in 2013 by the Physicist Damien P. George. TheMicroPython boards runs MicroPython on the bare metal and gives a low-levelPython operating system running interactive prompt or scripts.

    The MicroPython boards currently use 32 bit microcontrollers clocked at MHzand with RAM limited to tens or hundreds of Kbytes. These are themicrocontroller boards with official MicroPython support currently in thebeginning 2017 : Pyboard, Pyboard Lite, WiPy 1/2, ESP8266, BBC Micro:bit,LoPy, SiPy, FiPy. They cost between USD3-40, are very small and light, aboutsome to tens of mm in each dimension and about 5-10 g, have low powerconsumption, so MicroPython boards are affordable and can be embedded inalmost anything, almost anywhere.

    MicroPython boards have many electronic interfaces : digital input/output(GPIO) ports, analog inputs (via Analog Digital Converter), analog outputs(via Digital to Analog Converter), wireless (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa), etc. SoMicroPython on these boards can be used to control all kinds of electronicprojects.

    In terms of hardware, 2016 was the year of MicroPython, as new boardscompatible with MicroPython arrived : ESP8266 boards (there are more than 10types, with WiFi), BBC Micro:bit (with Bluetooth LE, free distributed to 1million British students of 11-12 year-old), LoPy (with LoRa, WiFi, BluetoothLE), SiPy (with Sigfox, WiFi, Bluetooth LE). Even a 5 network board wasannounced for April 2017 delivery, FiPy with LoRa, Sigfox, cellular LTE-CATM1/M2(NBIoT), WiFi, Bluetooth LE.

    In terms of software, MicroPython allows microcontroller programming directlywith Python 3, which is easier and more productive than programming withArduino IDE, C/C++, etc. And MicroPython is well suited for Internetprogramming, so MicroPython boards are a natural choice for IoT (Internet ofThings), for example running a simple web server to show a sensor output (textand graphics), sending sensor data to IoT cloud, etc. This fact is veryimportant as today there are some billions of IoT devices worldwide, and in2020 some tens of billions are expected.

    Even with RAM constraints (tens to hundreds of Kbytes), scientific MicroPythonis not only possible, but already available and practical to use, withMicroPython modules capable of numerical calculations, FFT (Fast FourierTransform), calculations with uncertainties, etc. I will list the scientificMicroPython modules which are available, as well as show how to port Python 3modules to MicroPython, squeezing the source code in tens of Kbytes.

    Some hints will be given to the FOSS community to be open minded aboutMicroPython : be aware that MicroPython exists, MicroPython is a betterprogramming option than Arduino in many ways, MicroPython boards are availableand affordable, porting more Python 3 scientific modules to MicroPython,MicroPython combines well with IoT.

    In this talk we'll take a close look at a one of the "smart" (WiFi-connected)light-bulbs available on the market today. The bulbs expose a small API overUDP that I used to run an interface on a programmable buttons array. We willsee how topics like reverse engineering, security, licensing, "self-hosting"and user experience came into play.

    monolight is an user interface to control LIFX WiFi-enabled light bulbs.monolight runs on a programmable button array; it is written in Python 3.6 (tohave type annotations and asyncio), and it interfaces with the bulbs through amore complex daemon written in C: lightsd.

    This talk will start with a live demo of the button grid remotely controllingthe light bulbs. We will then explore how it works and some of the motivationsbehind it (network isolation, trying to not depend on the "cloud",reliability, user-experience). Finally, we will look into what kind ofopportunities even more open IoT products could bring, and open leave theplace to Q&A and discussion.

    MsgFlo is a tool to build systems that span multiple processes and devices,for instance IoT sensor networks. Each device acts as a black-box componentwith input and output ports, mapped to MQTT message queues. One thenconstructs a system by binding the queues of the components together. Focus oncomponents exchanging data gives good composability and testability, bothimportant in IoT. We will program a system with MsgFlo using Flowhub, a visuallive-programming IDE, and test using fbp-spec.

    At the 2014 IoT devroom, we introduced flow-based programming (FBP) forheterogenous IoT systems, using NoFlo and MicroFlo. The programming modelworked well for individual devices, but between the devices of the system oursolution caused too tight coupling. When we realized this, we decided to buildMsgflo, which reuses many of the same concepts and tools.

    In MsgFlo each process/device is an independent participant, receiving data oninput queues, and sending data on output queues. A participant do not knowwhere the data comes from, nor where (if anywhere) the data will go. Thisstrong encapsulation gives good composability and testability. MsgFlo uses astandard message queue protocol (MQTT or AMQP). This makes it easy to use withexisting software. As each participant is its own process and communicate overnetworks, they can be implemented in any programming language. Conveniencelibraries exist for C++, Python, Arduino, Node.js and Rust. On top of themessage queue protocol, a simple discovery mechanism is added. For existingdevices without native Msgflo support, the discovery messages can be sent by adedicated tool.

    We have used Msgflo in a handful of real-life deployments, and willdemonstrate building a simple stand-alone IoT system.

    6LoWPAN enables, as the name implies, IPv6-communication over Low-powerWireless Personal Area Networks, e.g. IEEE802.15.4. A lot of resources areavailable to allow 6LoWPAN over IEEE802.15.4, but how can one extend the6LoWPAN feature-set for the use with other link layer types? This talk willcover the details about a generic implementation that should work with everylink layer type and how one can provide support for ones own custom wirelessnetwork. The goal is to give quite a technical and detailed talk with finallya discussion about when 6LoWPAN is actually useful and when is it not.

    Last year, as a summer project, I've implemented a generic 6LoWPAN adaptionlayer into picoTCP, an open source embedded TCP/IP-stack developed by AltranIntelligent Systems, with an eye on the IoT. I've made an effort to make theadaption layer as generic as possible allowing it to be easily expandable withnew link layer types and topologies. The layer should also be able to allowmultiple link-layer extensions, for post-network-layer processing. This couldbe used for mesh-under routing, link layer security, whatever you want. Thistalk will cover how one can take advantage of these features and caveats thatcome with it. I also have my personal thoughts on 6LoWPAN and I would like toshare them with you at the end of the talk.

    Let's see how we can build small IoT devices that can help blind people intheir daily life.

    The Word Health Organization estimates that more than 250 million peoplesuffer from vision impairment, 36 millions of them being entirely blind. Inmany cases, their impairment prevents them from living independently. Tocomplicate things further, about 90% of them are estimated to live in low-income situations.

    Project Lighthouse was started by Mozilla to try and find low-costtechnological solutions that can help vision-impaired people live and functionon their own. To this date, we have produced several prototypes designed toaid users in a variety of situations.

    Let's look at some of them.

    This will be a relatively low-tech presentation.

    IoT changed deeply the value chain. End users of consumer devices aim to havean instant gratification which is based on data/metrics produced by theobject. At the end, IoT makers have to execute an epic split: Build the actualdevice (mechanical and electronics), Be over the top in firmware developmentin order to be secured Design services based on the object data. Surroundingall that is a hard job for a product team. In such a context Open SourceSoftware constitutes basic building blocks of IoT devices. Data produced bysmart devices are often time series, storing them is not the challenge, manygood open source solutions exists (OpenTSDB, Influx..) but developingalgorithms based on your data is difficult. It can become a nightmare if youhave to think about scalability. Warp10 is a 3 years old open source platformdesigned for collect, store and manipulate sensor data with WarpScript, alanguage dedicated to time series analysis. WarpScript works natively on timesseries stored into Warp 10 (based on either levelDB or HBase) but can beconnected to any data source. When you manipulate sensor data, you must dealwith privacy. Security and privacy have also been addressed by Warp 10 sinceits very inception, this includes fine grain access control mechanisms,encryption capabilities and throttling management. Warp10 plateform can beintegrated into an open ecosystem likes Storm, Flink, or also Apache Pig withone cornerstone, the capatibility of manipulate time series with WarpScript.

    The Warp 10 Platform is designed to collect, store and manipulate sensor data.Sensor data are ingested as sequences of measurements (also called timeseries). The Warp 10 Platform offers the possibility for each measurement toalso have spatial metadata specifying the geographic coordinates and/or theelevation of the sensor at the time of the reading. Those augmentedmeasurements form what we call Geo Time Series.

    The first differentiating factor of Warp 10 is that both space (location) andtime are considered first class citizens. Working with Geo Time Series allowsyou to have geo-located readings without having to use four separate seriesand having to keep track of the reading context.

    Complex searches like “find all the sensors active during last Monday in theperimeter delimited by this geo-fencing polygon” can be done without involvingexpensive joins between separate time series for the same source.

    We created WarpScript, an extensible stack oriented programming language whichoffers more than 700 functions and several high level frameworks to ease andspeed your data analysis. Simply create scripts containing your data analysiscode and submit them to the platform, they will execute close to where thedata resides and you will get the result of that analysis as a JSON objectthat you can integrate into your application.

    The WarpScript approach is another differentiating factor of Warp 10.Traditional time series platforms offer few manipulation options, usually onlyproviding a SQL like query language which cannot express complex analysis, orproviding a reduced set of aggregation functions. These approaches force youto produce more code on the client side thus increasing your development timeand leading to massive transfers of unprocessed data from the platform to yourapplications. Our approach lets you focus on your business use cases,simplifying IoT and sensor data applications by taking care of a larger chunkof the data analysis in a very efficient way.

    For FOSEM we would like to excite developers - who have interest in working onuse-cases for Smart Cities, Utility Companies and other large-scaleinfrastructure companies - for the Open Smart Grid Platform. The Open SmartGrid Platform is an Open source IoT platform for large infrastructures. Theplatform allows you to monitor and control hardware in the public space. Withseveral (generic) functions ready to use, the main benefits of the Open SmartGrid Platform are: scalability & high availability, high security, its genericdesign, and no vendor lock-in.

    Introduction The Open Smart Grid Platform is an open source IoT platform. Theopen smart grid platform is a generic IoT platform, built for organizationsthat manage and/or control large-scale infrastructures. The following usecases are now readily available: smart lighting, smart metering, tariffswitching, and microgrids. Furthermore the following use-cases are indevelopment: distribution automation, load management and smart devicemanagement. The architecture of the open smart grid platform is modular andconsists multiple layers. External applications are connected to a servicedomain via the integration layer. This integration layer contains webservices. The service domain manages all the business rules such as: "Can weallow this change?”. The core component routes the messages to the correctprotocol adaptor and contains generic functions such as device management,time synchronization and firmware management. The protocol adaptors convertthe messages to a protocol that is used by the smart objects. This messagecould be a switching command, for example.

    The open smart grid platform is highly unique for embracing the open sourceapproach and the following key features: • Suitable for scalable environmentsdelivering high performance • High availability and multitenant architectures• Built with security by design and regularly tested. • It has a genericarchitecture. More use cases and domains are easily added to the platform. •The open smart grid platform is based on open standards where possible.

    More information can be found on: http://opensmartgridplatform.org/ andhttp://documentation.opensmartgridplatform.org/

    Proposal talk For FOSEM we would like to excite developers for our platform bydiscussing the reasoning behind the platform from a technical point of viewand the architecture of platform. We believe the platform is interesting fordevelopers who have interest in working on use-cases for Smart Cities, UtilityCompanies and other large-scale infrastructure companies.

    Modbus [1] is a serial communication protocol developed in 1979 for use withprogrammable logic controllers (PLCs). In simple terms, it is a method usedfor transmitting information over serial lines between electronic devices.,it’s openly published, royalty-free, simple and robust.

    Many industrial controllers can speak Modbus, we can also teach “hobby”devices like Arduino boards and ESP8266 to speak Modbus [2]. Reliable, robustand simple free software Modbus client [3] will be used to acquire the metricsfrom our device, then the metrics will be collected [6][7] and sent toHawkular and Grafana [8] to store and visualize our data.

    The OCF/IoTivity project aims to answer interoperability issues in the IoTworld from many different contexts to accommodate a huge range devices frommicrocontrollers, to consumer electronics such as Tizen wearables or yourpowerful GNU/Linux system The vision of Iotivity is not restricted to ad hocenvironment but also can be connected to Internet and make the service easilyaccessible by other parties. With cloud access in place, usage scenarios forIoT devices can be enriched immensely.

    In this talk we walk through the steps on how to practically handle IoT usecases that tailored towards various topologies. To introduce the approach usedin IoTivity, we first give a detailed background introduction on IoTivityframework. Then we will present a demo that shows a few examples, from settingup a basic smart home network to accessing the IoT resource via a third partyonline service. Challenges and solutions will be addressed from developmentand implementation aspects for each step of the demo.

    We hope this talk will inspire developers to create new IoT prototypes usingFLOSS,.

    This will be a shared presentation with Ziran Sun from Samsung Open SourceGroup.

    Open source games are even more open source if not only the source of the gameengine itself is available, but also all the other assets, such as sprites,samples, soundtracks et cetera also have their source available. What issource in the context of multimedia assets? And how can we create those assetsin a more source-like way?

    In this talk I will briefly point out the importance of source code, and whythis is also important for multimedia assets. I will show some file types, anddiscuss whether or not they are source, and if not what would be their source.Finally, I'll give a real example of creating music in the way a programmerwould write C or Python code, and compile the source of this music with amakefile into an Ogg Vorbis file. I hope this will bring more awareness aboutthe need for source code of multimedia to game developers, and hopefully itwill inspire others, including programmers that think they are not artistic,to create those assets, to share them, and to be able to learn from and modifythem.

    Introduction to Computer Vision via WebCam game example.

      * Try WebCam game during presentation  * Understand, how motion detection works with the help of `OpenCV` libraries  * Understand, the problem of low lighting and noise  * Hear real-world example of using WebCam games  * Fork and create your own WebCam game

    ### Who should attend

      * _[Mostly]_ **Software developers** , especially with the background of `C`/`C++` or willing to learn `OpenCV` – because speaker would be illustrating principles, how his game works, so later you could (fork and) create your own version.  * **Project managers and entrepreneurs** , because some business cases would also be discussed  * **Bored people** , who just want some interactive game during the presentation.

    ### Back-story for the presentation

      * Colleague from HR: _I found a video about augmented gaming climbing wall, would it be hard to implement something like it_.  * _Well... I was playing with similar technology some time ago_ – answered. Found my **6 years old project** and to my surprise – it **was still working** (actually spent about an hour to install dependencies and fix `include` values). That is what _backward-compatible_ open source software really means :)

    **WebCam based games still gives _WOW_ effect** (still trending, still looksnew). **But why it is not mainstream after 6 years?** To answer that question,lets dig into some implementation and bussiness use cases.

    ### Content of the presentation/DEMO

      * **Introduction** : LIVE demonstration of WebCam based game: Yes – audience could play from their seats by moving their hands :)  * **Business case** : Why not mass production? Example: advertisement for IT recruitment and meetups  * **Implementation details** : rocket science or comparing pixels (visual debugging info would be shown, while others are playing)? The problem of lighting and noise.  * **Discussion/question** : Why not mainstream: hardware problems, trend to (not) learn `C`/`C++`, difficulty of `OpenGL` lighting (if there would not be other questions)

    The Godot community has released a full-featured point'n'click adventure gameframework based on Godot Engine. It is fully open source (MIT licensed) andcomes with a great open source manual and demo game written by Ariel Manzur,the Escoria creator, and the FLOSS Manuals FR community. This presentationaims at showcasing Escoria, its features and the basics of using it, to giveattendants a good starting point for creating their own point'n'click games.

    Back when they kickstarted their Godot Engine-powered point'n'click adventuregame [The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça andPizzaboy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/330420/), its developers hadpromised that they would release the framework they developed under a free andopen source license. This finally happened in October 2016, after someimportant refactoring to make it suitable for any kind of point'n'click game.At the same time, a great open source manual and demo game (see links) werereleased, written by Ariel Manzur, the Escoria creator, and the FLOSS ManualsFR community.

    The free and open source world has therefore an advanced point'n'clickframework at the ready with both source code, demos and documentation, onlywaiting for game designers and artists to create awesome adventure games (bothopen source and proprietary, the engine license is not restrictive). To givean idea of the tool's maturity, Tim Schafer of LucasArts and Double FineProductions said of it, when visiting the developers of The InteractiveAdventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy, that "it looks just like SCUMM!" (theengine used by LucasArts for their classic adventure games). Escoria is basedon the 2D and 3D Godot game engine, and can thus leverage many features thatare not common in point'n'click adventure games, which allows for the creationof interesting hybrid genres.

    In this presentation, we will showcase the features of Escoria, how to setup anew project with it and use its scripting language to create classicpoint'n'click scenes. Basic knowledge of Godot's interface is not mandatory,as we will try to explain also what features are specific to Escoria and whichones are specific to Godot. The presentation will reuse elements of theexisting manual and demo in attempt to be as clear as possible, and to allowattendants to continue their discovery of Escoria using resources they arealready familiar with.

    ## Draw, play, erase, correct, scan & play anew!

    In this talk, we will share our experience in designing games that revolvearound interactive drawings (felt pen on paper, graff on walls, colored syrupon waffles...). How does such games work? First a camera captures the drawing,then we analyze it, use that information in our game, then we project back therendered game on the drawing to close the loop.

    First we will discuss the implications of such an analogical and free-forminput in term of user experience and possible gameplays. Then we will presentthe tech we have been developing to ease the development process. This impliedworking both on software (a library, the PTX system) and hardware (a kit foreasy setup).

    Many people learn to code because they want to write a computer game. Moreoften than not, they want to re-write their favourite game, but making it alittle easier! Unfortunately the gap between a personal project, open sourcegame, and professional offering is substantial, with the lack of polishobvious at every turn. In this talk, Steven Goodwin, a game developer of 20years standing (and 3 books on the subject), dissects each discipline (art,music, writing, and code) to explain where polish should be added and why it’sso rare to see open source games as effective as their commercialcounterparts.

    In theory, an open source game should be much better than a commercialversion. After all, as a group, we have more resources at our disposal, overmore time, in order to build more assets, write more code, and fix more bugs.But that’s rarely true. Our efforts look rushed and amateur in comparison.After a brief discussion on the meta-problems of open source game developmentwe look at each discipline and demonstrate what needs to be written to improvethe game, details of simple, but effective, visual improvements that can bedone with very little effort, and how certain functionality can be implementedin order to make a game shine. The talk also includes a checklist of featuresimplemented in Space Bounce that, while you might not have noticed them, youwould certainly realize if they weren’t there.

    "Snap is Scheme disguised as Scratch"

    Snap is the programming language used in UC Berkeley’s introductory CS coursenamed “The Beauty and Joy of Computing” (BJC). As part of the BJC curriculum,Snap is currently being disseminated nationwide across the U.S. to support thenew AP CS-Principles course created by the College Board. The NSF has awardedlongstanding grants to bring Snap and BJC to every high school in New YorkCity, the largest school district in the U.S.

    Snap is Scheme disguised as Scratch, a free and open web browser based visualprogramming language aiming to support a technically rigorous introductory CScurriculum at the college and high school level. Snap has been translated into39 languages and is used around the world, both as a teaching environment andin research projects.

    Snap borrows from Scratch its graphical LEGO blocks grammar and its 2D cartoonthemed microworld around a stage with sprite actors, costumes, events, andparallelism, combining it with Scheme’s dynamically typed and lexically scopedvariables, first-class lists, lambda (closures), first-class continuations andproper tail recursion, encouraging programmers to create their own controlstructures (loops, catch/throw, higher-order functions such asmap/filter/reduce) tail recursively without having to worry about stackoverflows. Snap supports nested sprites and lets programmers turn arbitraryJavaScript code into graphical blocks. Its “codification” mechanism cantranscompile graphical scripts into arbitrary textual code, offering a two-waytransition between blocks and text.

    Snap is implemented in JavaScript using HTML5 APIs. It has been renamed fromBYOB to Snap since version 4.0. Snap’s development has been supported by twoNSF grants.

    The first projects we are working is Tuning Game, in collaboration withContredanse asbl, and PEEL, a 3d puzzle game.

    It is open to visual artists, designers, academics, musicians, developers etenthusiasts focused on experimental video games, programming and interactiveapplications.

    It is a place dedicated to exploration of video game medium, aesthetically,theorically, artistically and technically.

    We are also careful about the influence of the tools on the work we do.Therefore, we choosed to work with a libre software suite, including blender,gimp and inkscape for content creation and Ogre3D, Puredata, Bullet and otherlibraries for the game engine. Other libre engines are welcomed.

    We are providing the game engine as a complete package, ready to install withinstallation procedure and examples.

    The openEMSstim is also a project that aims at informing people on how tobuild such devices. Rather than building devices by hacking existing devicesor building dangerous circuits from scratch, we intentionally designed it in away that it recycles existing medical stimulators, which are safe to use. Thisway, the openEMSstim is actually just a big (wireless and cool) potentiometerthat adjusts the intensity of the medical devices stimuli. The project keepson growing and aims at finding new form-factors, smaller PCB, simpler hardwarecomponents, wifi integration, etc.

    Wt is a C++ library for developing web applications and sites.

    Wt provides widget-centric API to write web application as if graphicalapplication. Wt translates this to Ajax powered site or to plain HTML sitedepending on the client. Unlike page-based frameworks or single-pageJavaScript frameworks, Wt creates stateful applications that are at the sametime highly interactive but still support plain HTML browsers or web crawlers.

    Luawt uses all the power of Wt in the world of Lua. Luawt is different frompopular solutions like Lapis and Sailor, because Wt is different. Targetcustomer of luawt wants to provide web interface to a library, written in C orLua. Luawt application can’t run directly from nginx.conf, but the applicationhas per-session state and its code looks like GUI application's code. Luawt isnot finished yet, but we have a number of solutions to automate generation ofbindings using gccxml, so we expect it to become a practical solution verysoon.

    We would like to give a talk about luawt in order to show its facilities anddemonstrate several examples how it could be applied in everyday webdevelopment.

    Internet Transport is changing, some changes have been incremental updates tomechanisms (e.g., RACK, BBR), others demand new protocol options (e.g., MPTCP)or entirely new protocols (e.g., QUIC, SCTP). However significant changes arestill difficult to deploy - requiring modifications to application code andsupport by the stack. Even when updates happen, the network needs to supportthe new method to allow applications to use it. Long deployment times havemotivated the need to change how protocols are handled in the stack. We reviewthe state of the art in Internet Transport, and the status of deployment in thBSD's and then propose a new direction for the transport interface, developedin the EU NEAT Project, that can ease deployment of new transports across allplatforms. We conclude by showing the advantages and its prospects forstandards adoption.

    One of the fundamental problems with UNIX-like operating systems is that theydon't seem to make it easy and intuitive to develop applications that arestrongly hardened against exploits through sandboxing. With CloudABI, we'retrying to make this process a lot easier, by having an environment that ispurely based on capability-based security.

    In another talk in the main track I'm going to give a more general talk aboutCloudABI, explaining what the mindset behind the project. During this talk inthe BSD devroom I want to focus on one specific aspect, namely how FreeBSD'sruntime environment for CloudABI works.

    CloudABI is a simplified POSIX-like runtime environment that is inspired byFreeBSD's Capsicum. It allows you to create programs that can solely interactwith the environment through file descriptors (capabilities). Compared totraditional UNIX-like systems, this approach has three advantages:

      1. It reduces the impact of exploits. If an attacker manages to take over control of a CloudABI application, it can only access those resources that the application was designed to use (for a networked service: typically an already bound TCP socket and some data directories). This is different from most traditional UNIX-like systems, where an attacker would gain access to all resources that the user running the application can access, which is very broad.  2. It makes applications easier to test. By knowing that an application can only access those resources that are provided explicitly, the entire environment in which the application runs can be customized for testing.  3. Similarly, it makes applications easier to deploy. This model tends to reduce the need for using containers and virtual machines. Applications can be started directly, while still providing the necessary isolation from the rest of the system.

    An interesting aspect of CloudABI is that it's cross-platform. You can compilea CloudABI program once and run exactly the same executable both on FreeBSD,macOS and Linux. In this talk I want to focus on this specifically: how isFreeBSD capable of running these programs? Topics I'll be covering during thistalk include:

      * FreeBSD's image activator framework: the code that parses and loads executables.  * The ELF file format  * System calls and system call tables  * vDSOs: Virtual Dynamic Shared Objects

    FreeBSD has supported disk encryption with GBDE and GELI since 2002 and 2005respectively. However, booting the system required storing the loader andkernel unencrypted so that the requisite GEOM module could be loaded to handledecryption. This became a significantly larger stumbling block with theintroduction of ZFS, as having multiple separate partitions detracts from theadvantages of ZFS, and also causes headaches when upgrading the operatingsystem. With the growing popularity of ZFS Boot Environments, a solution wasneeded that allowed the kernel and loader to remain part of the primary filesystem, even if it was encrypted. This paper provides an overview of thedesign of the GELI enabled BIOS boot code and loader, as well as the numerouschallenges encountered during their development.

    A walk through the tale of woe that was implementing support for GELI in theFreeBSD bootcode and loader. Hear the story of a very junior developerpersisting through countless complications and roadblocks to finally arrive atworking code. Learn just how complicated it is to boot a computer, and howmuch worse it can get. In the end, we are left with working ZFS BootEnvironments, even with fully encrypted pools.

    I will be discussing recent work by my team to use the Eclipse OMR JitBuildertechnology to improve the Lua interpreter performance. I will show the smallchanges required in the runtime to take advantage of the OMR JitBuildertechnology, show the performance improvements and discuss the trade offs ofusing a JIT.

    The Eclipse OMR project consists of a highly integrated set of open source Cand C++ components that can be used to build robust language runtimes thatwill support many different hardware and operating system platforms. The talkwill be focused mainly on the Compiler technology and specifically theJitBuilder and how it could be used by the Lua runtime. You can read moreabout the Eclipse OMR project at https://www.eclipse.org/omr/ and view thecode at https://github.com/eclipse/omr.

    In this talk, we will present the latest improvements done for ARM64 andMIPS64 platforms in LuaJIT. The talk will cover challenges related to new GC64mode, as well as arch-specific issues.

    Up to recently, the only 64-bit architecture that LuaJIT supported was x86_64and in the latest official release it had limits with addressable memory. Inthe meantime, new GC64 mode was finished which enabled LuaJIT to address47-bit address space. ARM64 and MIPS64 ports were done on the top of the newGC64 mode. We will discuss the current status of these ports and point outsome pending issues that could cause problems in today's software that usesLuaJIT. The talk will also be useful to those interested to port LuaJIT toanother architecture.

    Last year, at the 2016 LLVM dev room, I presented ideas on how to improve LNTto make performance tracking of LLVM generated code easier. We've implementedmost ideas since, and we're happy to see that our ideas work out in practice:quite often, understanding the root cause for a performance regression nowtakes about 5 to 10 minutes of work, whereas before it typically took us halfa day to produce all data that is now recorded automatically.

    I intend to give a demo of how we use LNT at ARM's LLVM teams. I'll alsodiscuss how LNT is useful for other projects that need to track performance ofgenerated code. LNT is starting to be used by at least also some GCC, java jitand even a Verilog-to-C++ compiler teams.

    I'll also give the necessary pointers on what you need to get started on LNTfor your own projects.

    For decades developers try to build a bug free software. Numerous techniquesand metrics were developed. However, there is still a need in an approach thatcan both assert program domain and provide some reliable metrics. And suchapproach exists. It is called Mutation Testing. Here is a brief overview:

    There is a function and a test for that function. Any semantic change in thefunction (so called 'mutant') should break the test ('kill mutant'). If that'snot the case, then mutant is considered as survived. No mutants should surviveever. If they are, then either the test is bad or the function is not correct.

    Research in this area exists since 70's. However, this approach is not widelyadopted. The computational cost is one of the blockers. Another one, is theway such systems are implemented: most of them do mutations at the AST level,hence they are tightly coupled to the particular languages.

    We want to present you Mull: our implementation of Mutation Testing system. Weuse JIT and runtime compilation to speedup the system and make it accessiblefor everyday usage. Besides that we go down to the IR level, making the systemapplicable for any LLVM-based language such as C, C++, Rust, Objective-C, andmany others.

    Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) is an optimization technique which usesinformation about the runtime profile of an application. The binary of anapplication is instrumented to collect data like number of times a function iscalled. This additional information is used to apply advanced optimizations tothe application. PGO is an area of active development in LLVM. A recent updateof LDC, the LLVM-based D compiler, is able to use PGO. In this talk I discusswhich additonal IR code must be generated for PGO and how it was implementedin LDC. I also show the effect of PGO on a test application and the compileritself.

    ESBMC is a SMT-based context-bounded bounded model checker that aims toprovide bit-precise verification of both ANSI-C and C++ programs. Thepresentation will briefly introduce the tool and then show the usage oflibtooling as a frontend for the tool, including the problems we had duringthe development and what we hope for the future.

    On the first half of the talk, I'll describe the tool and present someexamples of its usage, including the verification of concurrent programs.

    I'll then focus on the tool's new frontend, which generates the AST of theprogram using clang's libtooling and converts it to an internal format that'sused for the verification. This second half of the presentation will befocused on the development of the C frontend and the yet to be C++ frontend,including how we had to adjust to the libtooling API.

    The aim of the talk is to present the difficulties that we faced when movingaway from our frontend to clang, including limitations we found during thedevelopment. I'll end the talk with what we hope for the future, as users ofclang, which translates to easier access to some of clang's internals(specially the static analyser).

    Security is an every increasing concern across the computing industry, mostrecently in the emerging Internet of Things market. The compiler is the onetool that sees just about every piece of code, and is a position to both checkfor security and improve security. LLVM cannot magically write secure code,but it can help a professional programmer write really good secure code.

    In this talk we will introduce our joint research program with BristolUniversity to add such features to LLVM. This project is still in its earlystages, but we will present our initial work and discuss our future plans. Aparticular goal is community feedback on the priorities for this researchprogram.

    Security is an every increasing concern across the computing industry, mostrecently in the emerging Internet of Things market. LLVM cannot magicallywrite secure code, but it can help a good programmer write secure code.

    The Leakage Aware Design Automation project is an EPSRC funded programmerunning over four years at Bristol University led by Elizabeth Oswald and DanPage. It is looking at how all aspects of software tooling can improvesecurity of systems, particularly by minimizing information leakage. Animportant part of this project is extending compiler technology, and theprogramme includes a postdoctoral post to research this area.

    Embecosm are the "industrial supporters" of this project. Our role is to takethe research ideas and make them work in real compilers - including LLVM. Someof this will be about guiding the programmer - warning of coding styles thatare insecure. The other part of the project is providing assistance to theprogrammer in implementing advanced cryptographic techniques.

    Many of the areas the compiler can warn about are related to informationleakage which can be detected by variation in power usage, program timing ormemory access. Where we see control flow, cycle times or memory accesses whichdepend on critical variables (such as cryptographic keys). Such variables canbe marked with a "sensitive" attribute and the compiler warn if they or theiraliases are involved in control flow, impact cycle timing or affect memoryaccess.

    There are a great many techniques that users can adopt to make their code moresecure. Some of these are straightforward for the compiler to implement. Forexample ensuring that critical functions clear their stack frame on return orlongjmp.

    It is not difficult to slice the top off a memory chip and use a scanningelectron microscope to read values. A (relatively) easy way to scan forcandidate cryptographic keys. Bit-splitting defends against this, butscattering individual bits of critical values throughout memory, combiningthem on the fly for a calculation and scattering them back out to memory. Byhand this is laborious in the extreme, but the compiler can reduce this to asimple "bit-split" attribute on a variable.

    Other attacks use intense radiation to disrupt a processor or memory. The hopeis that a critical variable will be impacted. To fix this, code will oftenrepeat important operations. A standard compiler optimizer will promptlyremove such operations, so such code is used unoptimized. But it would be muchbetter to tell the compiler which bits of code to leave in place. Or evenbetter to identify code at danger and let the compiler insert the duplicateoperations automatically.

    There are many other techniques which we hope to explore in this project,including \- atomicity - balancing control flow paths to minimize informationleakdave \- shuffling - varying the time at which particular instructions areexecuted \- algorithmic variation - using different algorithms at random toperform operations. \- machine learning and superoptimization to minimizeinformation leakage? \- automated identification of instruction set extensionsto improve cryptographic robustness?

    Some of these techniques are not new, but none are yet in mainstreamcompilers. We plan to add these features and new ideas which our academiccolleagues are researching. The project is still in its early stages and thepurpose of this talk is to raise awareness and get community feedback on someof the areas we will be working on, and suggestions for other areas toconsider.

    LLVM has a great track record for being able to target a large range ofprocessors, both large 32/64-bit devices and deeply embedded 8/16-bitprocessors. From most perspectives, from Clang through to code generation, thesize of most operations do not make much difference to the ease ofimplementation. However there are some assumptions that are baked deeply intothe compiler; one of which is the memory access width, more specifically thatit is addressible in 8-bit words. This however is not always the case, manyembedded DSPs can only access memory with 16-bit addressibility, and trying toteach LLVM about this proves to be a challenge.

    In this talk, we will present our first explorations in this area, and shareour thoughts on how we can make LLVM more memory agnostic for all targets withnon-8-bit memory.

    Media file formats grow progressively more and more complex every year andsupporting them all requires tremendous effort of all the FOSS developers.It's a problem that concerns not only low-level library developers, but higherlevel software as well: for example, audio sequencer or video editor developerwill still need solid understanding of underlying media file format structureto be able to debug any problems with it (like non-standard chunks inserted bysome properitary software). We'd want to present Kaitai Struct, a newfree/open source solution for file format dissecting, visualization andparsing. It is "write one - run everywhere" solution, where one needs tospecify declarative file format spec once, and then compile it into ready-madeparsing library in a large variety of supported target languages. And ourvisualization tools make Kaitai Struct work like "Wireshark for media files".

    Kaitai Struct started as an in-house tool in 2014 and was initially releasedas open-source project to public at March-April, 2016, supporting only 2target languages: Java and Ruby. Since then, we've collected 400+ stars aGitHub, hundreds of praising testimonials, got about a dozen of contributors,implemented support for 8 languages, got a handful of useful tools, likeconsole visualizer, GUI visualizer, [WebIDE](https://kt.pe/kaitai_struct_webide/), etc.

    Kaitai Struct is frequently compared to proprietary template-enabled hexeditors (like 010 Editor, Synalize It! or Hexinator), but goes one stepforward: it's not only about highlighting entities in hex dump, but also itcan automatically generate working API from spec, which accelerates work offile formats considerably and greatly reduces human factor errors whendeveloping parsers by hand. One's guaranteed to get exactly the same parsingresult both in visualizer and using the compiled API. And, what's important,it's free and open source.

    Some other comparable projects include BinPAC (but it's C++ only), Preon(which is Java-only), PADS (which targets only C & Haskell), and Construct(Python only). In comparison, Kaitai Struct offers cross-language support, andincludes visualization tools.

    For media file dissection, we have a growing collection of well-known mediafile formats (including MP4 / QuickTime .mov, AVI, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc),and other interesting file formats (like executables, byte-code, networkprotocols, etc, etc). We hope that open media software developers would findKaitai Struct to be a helpful ally in their arsenal of tools to deal with thediverse world of modern file formats.

    The session will look at the issues developers run into when developing theirown WebRTC applications. It looks at the problematic elements in the API, thecompatibility problems between browsers, missing infrastructure, and even thehuman element. All in all, it's a demonstration that a true WebRTC applicationcan't be built in a snap.

    Last year, I presented a talk explaining how easy it is to build a WebRTCapplication.

    This year, I'll tell you the truth!

    It will cover both the ideas and code necessary to move your basic applicationinto something that resembles production-ready.

    There are many considerations when building a large SIP infrastructure. Thistalk will focus on some of the key challenges and decisions that must be madewhen designing such a system, and how Asterisk can be deployed as ahorizontally scalable application server in such a system.

    While there is no right way to build a large SIP infrastructure, there arecertainly wrong ways. Often, design decisions have to be made early in theconstruction of an infrastructure that balance trade-offs affectingperformance, scalability, and ease of development/deployment.

    This talk will explore these trade-offs and design decisions when buildingsuch an infrastructure using Kamailio and Asterisk. This includesinvestigating considerations surrounding: * Managing SIP location andregistration * Call routing * SIP subscriptions and event handling *Communications application development

    Ring is free software for communication developed by Savoir-faire Linux in ourMontréal offices. It was conceived and developed on a peer-to-peerarchitecture model, relying on OpenDHT, its dedicated distributed hash tablefor retrieving its users on the network. Ring's Beta 2 version released onnovember 4th 2016 provides many new features for its users. The mostinteresting of them is the identity and account management mechanism,implementted on a blockchain Ethereum technology.

    Since the project started and the software's first release about 2 years ago,Ring has evolved in many directions. Our new Beta 2 release features newfuncionalities developed to improve the user's experience: The Multi-devicefunction makes it possible for users to associate many devices to the sameidentity (many RingID's to the same identity/person), and all the devices willbe synchronized. The Blockchain supports the multi-device feature for theidentity and account management. It is implemented on an Ethereum technology.OpenDHT library was enhanced in order to optimize user's retrieval on the p2pnetwork and decrease the network's operations time. Ring is now available onUWP (Universal Serial Platform thus offering support for Ring's clients ondifferent platforms supported and maintained from Microsoft.

    Finally, we are planning to release Ring's first stable version in a fewmonths, which will introduce new elements and potentially a higer level ofsoftware reliability, users' privacy protection, utilisability and a betteruser experience

    Converse.js is an XMPP-based webchat application that can be used as astandalone application or it can be customized and integrated into anywebsite. In this talk I'll provide an introduction to Converse.js and I'llalso explain the infrastructure required to integrate and host XMPP-basedwebchat.

    ## What is XMPP and how do I integrate it into a website?

    I'll provide a brief introduction to XMPP (as presence and chat protocol) andthe two main technologies for integrating XMPP into the webbrowser (long-polling with BOSH versus websockets).

    ## What is Converse.js?

    Next follows an introduction to Converse.js, which is a webchat client thatcan be used standalone, or which can be integrated into any website. Then I'lltalk about how Converse.js came to be, what it was originally used for, whereit's been integrated and what's been done with it since.

    ## How to integrate webchat into your website

    In this section, I'll provide an outline of what's needed to create a webchatsolution for your website. I'll mention XMPP servers, BOSH connectionmanagers, XEPs (XMPP protocol extensions) that you'll likely want to enable,and more. I'll also elaborate on how you might want to enable communicationbetween your web app's backend and an XMPP server.

    ## Plans for the future

    I'll then finish off by discussing plans for future improvements andenhancements to Converse.js

    In the modern real time communication world, WebRTC is being paired withmultiple channels and services to provide an unparalleled customer experience.Utilizing automated speech recognition allows us to build advanced assistiveservices such as real time captioned phone calls for hearing impaired people,simultaneous translation tools and automated bot assistants. All of that canbe achieved leveraging modern open source software such as Adhearsion, theRuby telephony application framework, FreeSWITCH, Flite, PocketSphinx and(optionally) external APIs such as IBM Watson. Our experience in developingthat kind of service will be presented and discussed, plus code samples and alive demo.

    Wrapping FreeSWITCH's WebRTC capabilities with Adhearsion acting as the calllogic and the "glue" between parts makes creating rich ASR-enabledapplications easier. Adhearsion allows you to leverage the full power of Rubyto access APIs, send messaging and updates, and use databases. IntegratingFreeSWITCH with third party APIs who do not provide a direct interface, suchas IBM Watson and Wit.ai, through Adhearsion and Ruby. ASR and sentimentanalysis will provide our IVRs with an unparalleled ability to not onlyunderstand what callers say, but also what their desires and intent are.Dialplan applications can be complex to set up to use those APIs, and webapplications are not well suited to that type of application. Adhearsion, theRuby voice application framework, makes it easy and fun!

    Telepathy Bell is a telepathy connection manager that enables a telepathyfront end for Ring. Ring is a privacy focused communication application thatuses a distributed peer to peer network for real time communications. In thistalk, I would like to share my experience while creating Telepathy Bell.

    The idea behind Telepathy is to unify all communications. Severalcommunication services like IM, VOIP etc. implement their own desktop clients.This leads to duplication of effort and sometimes poor integration. Most ofthese features can be abstracted and their functionalities can be integratedto provide a unified user experience. A normal everyday user will use thetelepathy client application to communicate. This could lower the entrybarrier for many applications and make it convenient for the user to managecommunication services in a single client application.

    Through my talk, I would like to share my experience during GSoC and beyond ofcreating a telepathy connection manager for Ring.

    How can we secure IoT and provide for a robust single point of access? XMPPPowered by Tigase can provide an easy touchless setup, a single point ofaccess, and secure access to connected devices.

    Currently the IoT world is a wild west of open devices and insecure access.Given the recent DDoS attack on the eastern seaboard of the US being spawnedby such technology, it may be easy to disregard the IoT as a flash in the pantechnology without much promise. But to do this would be to discount thebenefits the Internet of Things can offer. Using the real time communicationpower and built in security of XMPP, we at Tigase have developed an instantaccess box to serve as a unified device for IoT devices while providing easysetup for your internet connected devices.

    Consider a home thermostat that is IoT enabled. Currently, the device itselfis forward facing using some sort of HTTP page, protected by a simple passwordchallenge. To be able to access this device while outside your home network,you will need to leave this device exposed to the greater internet. Yourpublicly available IP now has a front door that can be beaten by brute force.Granted, the worst somebody could do in that situation is inflate your HVACbill for a day until you figure out that 18°C is not an appropriate housetemperature. Still, many devices that feature IoT come with very littleunified security built in, and even then may have the most rudimentary ofsecurity built in.

    XMPP can provide the solution; a single device to unify, secure, and provideaccess to IoT devices in the home.

    mediasoup is a WebRTC SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) for Node.js that allowsapplications to run multiparty video conferencing with browser and mobiledevices in a multi-stream fashion.

    Rather than being yet another standalone media server, mediasoup is a Node.jslibrary/module which can be easily integrated within existing applications.

    mediasoup exposes both, the ORTC API and the WebRTC API (same as in browsers),allowing the application to program multiparty video conferencing viaJavaScript. mediasoup is minimalist, it just focuses on media handling. Itdoes not provide, nor it mandates, a specific network signaling protocol.

    The talk will expose the technology behind mediasoup, the API it exposes, anda demo application the assistants will be able to join.

    This presentation introduces a new modular mechanism for implementing livestate and event notifications within the context of Janus WebRTC serverinstances, for the purpose of allowing administrators and developers tomonitor and handle WebRTC sessions more effectively.

    Janus is a general purpose open source WebRTC server and gateway. It allowsyou to implement heterogeneous and complex WebRTC multimedia applicationsusing the different functionality it provides as modules, and can interactwith legacy technologies as well in the process (e.g., SIP or RTSP). Anintroduction to Janus was made ad Fosdem '16. This new presentation is aimedto address a new feature recently added to Janus, and currently being workedon in a separate branch that will soon be merged.

    Specifically, a modular mechanism has been designed and implemented to allowmodules to receive asynchronous and live events of several different typesfrom Janus and its plugins, in order to then handle them accordingly.Notifications can be about whatever is happening in a Janus instance, e.g.,Janus sessions/handles and their states, PeerConnections and their lifecycle(SDP exchanges, ICE and DTLS state changes, etc.), application plugininternals and related events, and so on. These new modules can then decidewhether to just forward these events, or a subset of them, to an externalbackend for further processing, or process them themselves. Use case examplesare simple debugging, live monitoring, troubleshooting, storing on DBs orother systems in a structured way, CDRs, etc. Within the context of Janus,this is particularly useful as so far the only API available to administratorshas been a query/response API to monitor the WebRTC internals of Janus itselfand a few other aspects, which limited the scope of what admins could do toeffectively manage a Janus instance.

    At the time of writing, a single module implementing this mechanism exists,one we implemented ourselves as a proof of concept and that simply forwardsall events as JSON objects to an external web server. In the future moremodules will be implemented to cover more practical scenarios, hopefully bythird-party developers as well.

    When moving from a linear processing architecture to an event-oriented one,OpenSIPS becomes able to handle more advanced SIP scenarios, as well as toperform complex integrations with external applications.

    The new OpenSIPS version follows a Subscribe/Notify model, which allows theSIP routing to be driven by events. These events are triggered from bothinside and outside OpenSIPS, and are internally dispatched by OpenSIPS to theright process/subscriber.

    During this presentation, I will show how the asynchronous architecture revampof the upcoming OpenSIPS 2.3 facilitates a series of state-of-the-artintegrations (SIP transaction pausing while push notifications are takingeffect, custom suspend-resume logic while waiting for an external event,etc.).

    The discussion will also include OpenSIPS scripting, and how we tweaked it toincorporate all these changes in a simple, straightforward, and efficientmanner.

    It'll throw your traffic over TLS, over DANE, over SATCOM.

    It'll log it all.

    It'll protect your autonomous security domain.

    The talk gives an overview of fuzzing of media formats based on our experiencein Google Chrome. Besides those tips and tricks, we will also share how OpenMedia developers may join a recently announced OSS-Fuzz project to use apowerful (thousands of CPU cores) and automated fuzzing infrastructure forfree.

    In this talk, we will be speaking about guided in-process approach to fuzzingof Media-processing projects. We will explain advantages of continuous fuzzingusing libFuzzer fuzzing engine, different memory tools such asAddressSanitizer and others fuzzing engines as well.

    Media processing is always a complex thing. An appropriate and fine-tuned fuzztesting is a great way to uncover lots of security and stability issues. Justremember [Stagefright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagefright_%28bug%29) or[FFmpeg and a thousand fixes](https://security.googleblog.com/2014/01/ffmpeg-and-thousand-fixes.html), for example.

    At the end of the talk, we will share success stories of libFuzzer applicationfor fuzzing of Media processing in Chromium browser and other projects.

    Also we will present OSS-Fuzz project aimed to help Open Source Software tohave continuous fuzzing at scale.

    The talk is meant for C/C++ developers and test engineers working on Media-processing projects. After the talk, attendees will be able to writelibFuzzer-based fuzzers, will know how to analyze performance of theirfuzzers, how to improve them, and, finally, will be able to increase testcoverage of their projects by adding of continuous fuzz testing.

    For a long time the multimedia world has had to pay attention to whom theintellectual property of a codec or tool belonged to such that they could payroyalties for each and every device or program using it. In 2012 thestandardization of Opus changed that for audio through the combined effort ofseveral individuals who were part of the free software community and largecompanies bringing together their research and patents and offering it forfree use by everyone. By avoiding existing patents, interesting new techniquesfor efficient audio compression were invented. Now, in the effort to make aroyalty free video codec in the same spirit as Opus, even more companies havejoined into the "Alliance for Open Media" organization, with its first codectitled "AV1". Starting from the codebase of Google's VP9 codec, AV1 hascurrently over 45 experimental coding tools contributed by its membercompanies with the hopes that many will make it into the final version of thecodec. This talk will serve as an update to the overall progress of the codecas well as to briefly explain the principles of operation of several codingtools expected to make it into the final version.

    I worked on “Port NMatrix to JRuby” in the context of GSoC 2016. Theperformance of NMatrix-JRuby is outstanding even without making use of JRubythreading capabilities. Also, I am working on ArrayFire gem that helps in easyGPU computation and is 1e4 to 1e7 times faster than NMatrix gem

    JRuby is known for performance. NMatrix, a linear algebra library, nowsupports JRuby. All SciRuby gems that depend on NMatrix can now be run onJRuby. A scientific library must be highly efficient as the programs can bememory intensive. The programs must be fast at the same time. This calls foroptimization.

    Suppose, you are running a Ruby program and you need to make it faster; youuse threads, yet you are not happy with the results! Just chain the Rubymethods to Java methods. Using Java method can improve the speed, around 1000times when compared to using Ruby method. Not only speed, it can help you savea lot of RAM, around 10 times. JRuby’s Garbage Collection can sometimes slowdown your program if you are not careful with handling a large amount of data.

    I would also like to share about ArrayFire gem that would be soon availablefor MRI that can be used for high-performance GPU computing using OpenCL/CUDA.

    Even if mruby core works on Windows, any mruby app is may not work if thelibraries it depends on don’t compile and run on Windows. Using Rust, we canwork towards building an ecosystem that is Windows compatible. This talk walksthrough building mruby libraries that do that.

    Unlike some other languages like JavaScript, Java, or Python, Ruby is notknown for it’s ability to run well on Windows. The Windows environment isoften treated as a second or third class citizen even though there are manypotential users. Part of this is due to Ruby’s strong POSIX oriented standardlibrary. This has mostly been ok since most Ruby applications are hosted andrun on UNIX servers.

    mruby is a lightweight Ruby that can be linked and embedded inside otherapplications. Being embeddable means that the runtime host could be Windows.mruby also has no Operating System specific standard library. Since theecosystem is young, there’s potential for an ecosystem that is Windowsfriendly. But writing cross platform native extensions in C for mruby is stilldifficult.

    Rust is a modern systems programming language that is fast and built toprevent segfaults and guarantee thread safety. It’s more than just a compiler,it’s a platform that has a great dependency manager and cares about crosscompilation out of the box. This makes it a great candidate over C to writenative extensions.

    In this talk, we’ll go over some basic Rust and how we can integrate this towrite mruby libraries that compile on Linux, OS X, and Windows. It’ll dig intonot only writing the library code, but also the mruby C API as well as themruby/Rust binding layer that makes this all possible.

    C Ruby's garbage collector has come a long way since the good old days of Ruby1.8. We'll walk through over 20 years of GC history in the C Ruby runtime, andalong the way we'll talk about the key features that were added with each Rubyversion. We'll cover the 5 (!) different GC algorithms C Ruby has used since1.8, copy-on-write optimization, and possible optimizations for the future. Noprior knowledge of GC or the C Ruby runtime is required for this talk.

    By covering the long and varied history of Ruby GC, this talk ends up being ageneral introduction and discussion of concepts in garbage collection in high-level languages. We'll cover the 5 different algorithms Ruby has used, copy-on-write optimization, and how the Ruby C API has sometimes held back garbagecollection in the runtime. I'm aiming this talk at people who have neverthought about such topics before, but have a few years of Ruby experienceunder their belt.

    I have been debugging and writing about issues in Ruby memory usage for sometime now, and I think we could all benefit from plugging up this "leakyabstraction" in our Ruby knowledge.

    So far most presentations of Perl 6 I have seen are addressed to people thatalready know Perl and that are pretty advanced programmers. I want to learnPerl 6 myself, and I also want to create material that can be used to raisepassion for the language when it's used as a first(ish) language. So I haveconvinced my daughters to create a study group where I will prepare materialsand follow a project-based and design-thinking approach to learn Perl 6. Myintention is also to find the way towards a more gender-balanced, inclusivecommunity and test new ways of learning computer programs by eating my own dogfood (as presented in other conferences).

    During the talk, which will be a dialogue, and maybe staged as a play, we willpresent our experience, what we have learned from it, what we haven't learnedfrom it (hope Perl 6 is not in this category) and how others might benefitfrom it. I am uploading the material to http://github.com/JJ/perl6em, whereyou can see it's still a work in progress.

    I will discuss some of the types of optimisations that I performed on theRakudo Perl 6 Core to make Rakudo Perl 6 about 3x faster in 2016 for manyapplications. How some optimisations became less necessary because ofoptimisations in MoarVM and/or nqp, but still made sense to do in the end. Howa lot of optimisations were just about cutting out unnecessary intermediatesteps that would make sense in any programming language. And how readabilityand elegance of the code suffered. No C code was involved, so basic Perlskills should be enough to follow this presentation.

    The phrase ""Domain Specific Language"" can be used to describe a set ofsyntactic constructs which either form an independent language, or are part ofa more general language. Informal DSLs arise from particular communities,evolve over time and often lack formal specifications. Examples include:templating languages, micro web frameworks, and various wiki markup languages.Perl 6 provides a number of mechanisms for parsing and interpreting suchinformal DSLs, including custom operators, grammars, and slangs. In this talk,we examine these mechanisms and demonstrate how they can be applied tospecific DSLs.

    Toolbars are a common toolkit control that have been around since the dawn ofGUI applications, providing direct access to an application's most frequentlyused functions. But with increasing scope, the number of frequently usedfunctions grows to an extent that can have a detrimental impact on quicklylocating a particular item. LibreOffice made it possible to create UI basedtoolbars on blank canvas where designers have all the freedom to do whateverthey want with the space. The talk will present the reasoning behind theNotebookbar layout with contextual groups.

    This talk will present two ways of working with LibreOffice user interfaceelements for an extension or a macro - legacy Basic dialog designer, as wellas the new feature using .ui files editable by Glade

    User interface for LibreOffice extensions and macros has never really been inthe spotlight of attention of LibreOffice developers and users despite thefact that built-in dialog designer was pretty advanced piece of software inits time. It still contains quite some powerful features (such as drag-and-drop editor, live preview or easy access to l10n). And while core LibreOfficedialogs have been converted to modern .ui format (thus making it possible forLibreOffice developers to use even more powerful UI editor - Glade),LibreOffice peripherals were still stuck with legacy home-grown obscureformats.

    Come and see for yourself that extensions and macros don't have to be dull,interfaceless pieces of software and that with minimum effort and basicknowledge of UI design, you can make them rock. Now you can even use all thecapabilities of Glade as .ui format can be read by/included in extension ormacro as well.

The talk will present this dashboard, and will explainhow to interpret the data it provides.

    The Document Foundation Development Dashboard visualizes data obtained fromsome systems used to support LibreOffice development: git, Gerrit, Bugzilla...The data is retrieved from them, stored, organized an massaged in a database,and later visualized in the dashboard. The dashboard permits to track activity(in commits, issues, pull requests, questions and answers, etc.), actors (whois creating the code, who is fixing bugs, who is answering questions), andprocesses (hot long does it take to close issues, or to accept pull requests).

    The Document Foundation Development Dashboard has been deployed usingGriomoireLab, an complete FOSS system for retrieving data from softwaredevelopment repositories, storing it, and producing different kinds ofanalytics, dashboards and reports.

    Currently the LibreOffice help system is based on a technology developed circa2005, and uses the internal Writer - Web module to display its contents. Thispresentation introduces our efforts to bring the LibreOffice Help system intoa modern 2017 technology, preserving our legacy contents and l10n processes.

    ## Introduction

    Currently the LibreOffice help system, here forth called HC2 is based on atechnology developed circa 20051, and uses the internal Writer - Web module todisplay its contents. HC2 uses a combination of XML and XLST technology todisplay contents in Writer/Web and is historically bounded to HTML version 3.2. As a consequence, the HC2 misses multimedia resources such as videos,animations as well as a modernized concept of CSS and Javascript for betteruser experience.

    Further, the HC2 XML schema (XHP) requires special tools (HelpAuthoring) forediting its contents and a simple inspection on the schema indicates most ofits elements are now part of W3C standard HTML5, turning XHP almost obsolete.Current help authoring tools are buggy and requires steep learning curve forthe unskilled volunteers.

    ## History of LibreOffice XML Help

    LibreOffice Help System was designed and implemented in 2005 by SUNMicrosystems ant the times where the "Browswer war" raged and no standardpublished by W3c was adopted in full by the major browser players. The WWWhijack by major corporations was played in the browser battlefield, twistingspecs and invalidating page rendering to build fences around browsers andservers and creating silos of web display technologies;

    SUN Microsystem adopted an internal only solution, with a A specific XML (XHP)to hold contents and navigation and an internal browser (Writer Web), thatbeared a resticted HTML 3.2 specification, together with a C++ wrapper tocreate index and proper calls

    ## 2017 issues for Help System

    The current (2005) help system is in a state that is is complex edit/updatecontents, hard to test and visualize results. There is no rich text availableexcept an authoring extension to LibreOffice that uses Writer as rich texteditor but has several issues in exportng and importing xhp files. To use thisextension features is as hard as learning XHP itself and as hard as to attemptto edit content with a simple text editor as vim or emacs.

    Furthemore the rich text authoring is bounded to the current XHP schema,doubling the effort when it comed to evolove XHP, because the tools mustfollow the new schema.

    The current HTML 3.2 implemetation with LibreOffice Writer / Web rendereingengine, is also bounded to simple images and text, and no video nor anothermultimedia resource is avalable for the user.

    ## General requirements

    The new help system for LibreOffice must support important requirements

    It must preserve legacy contents, composed into thousands of XHP filescovering all 6 LibreOffice modules and an internal user guide.

    It must also preserve the dozens of translations done on these legacy XHPfiles and the translation process must be ideally preserved or incur in theleast perturbation possible.

    It must use open, royalty free standars of web technologies, supoort all majorbrowsers of 2017, OS independent.

    It must be of easy access, low entry barrier for newbies, volunteers an havesupport of ease of use editing tools.

    It must be perfectly handled by git version control

    It must work Off-line and on-line

    ## Strategy

    The strategy of the project is in 2 pieces

    1) Progressively phase out XHP and phase-in HTML5

    HTML5 is a serious candidate to deserve our efforts to bring back our hepcontent into a general purpose rendering technology, suport moder CSS,javascript, other companion technologies

    2) Develop a micro javascript server capable of

      * Display the correct help page required by the LibreOffce applicaiton  * Use most of the resources such as navigation history, bookmarking, caching incluced in any major browser  * Handle indexing and searching text among pages  * support XHP and HTML simultaneously

    ## Demo

    We will demo where we are at the moment

    ## Concusions

    Part of the cost of a technology adoption is its capability to be quicklyabsorbed by its target audiences. Documentation and help systems plays a keyrole for the adoption of LibreOffice not only in the home but also in thecorporations. Having a dynamic and rich help content that can make users feelthe better experience in seeking help is a key step LibreOffice project istaking to inclrease its popularity. The project described here is our currentstatus and will be real very soon.

    The crash reporter showed that the LibreOffice project has a serious updateproblem with users using old versions and not updating to newer versions. Thetalk will present the work on the automatic updater as well as the approach tocollect some user statistics to improve the crash reporter.

    Based on the Mozilla updater code an automatic updater has been underdevelopment for the LibreOffice project for quite some time. Based on theexperiences with the crash reporter the need for an automatic updater has beenshown to be a serious problem for the project. The talk will show the currentapproach used in the automatic updater code, open challenges and how thisallows to rethink the installation and packaging experience. Based on theprototype server the talk will also show how the server can be used togenerate am estimation for active daily users (ADU) and how the informationabout the number of ADU can be used to enhance other services.

    OpenOffice Basic is cool. It can manipulate everything in your document,spreadsheets and slides. It helps you to create complicated reportsautomatically. But OpenOffice Basic is not cool. It lacks everything a modernhardcore developer needs: Personal favorite text editors, version controls,source repositories, etc. OpenOffice Basic macros are created and edited onlywith Basic IDE, and stored in some hidden place in your hard disk, not in thesource form but in XML. They cannot be managed with modern development toolslike svn, git, different text editors, and cloud storage backup.

    What if there is a tool that let you work off-line, out of the OpenOfficeBasic IDE box, with your favorite text editor, on anywhere on your hard drive?That's why I wrote obasync to do this job: Synchronize your local Basic macrosources with OpenOffice Basic storage. It frees me from Basic IDE and I canapply every source code development tools now.

This allowsdevelopers on all platforms to use their preferred environment and still IDEfeatures like code-completion on many of them without the need to manuallymaintain all of those. Gbuild, the LibreOffice build system, exports mostrelevant data about this to JSON files, which then can be used to createproject solutions on multiple IDEs.

    Despite being 15 years old, Haiku still has some nice things to show off andinspire others.

    From x-ray navigation to multithreaded-by-default applications, Haiku is meantto be responsive even on older machines.

    We will also discuss how Haiku can relate to XDG standards, considering itdoesn't use X11, is not a Unix clone, and also has its share of legacy.

    In this talk, we will go through an end-to-end web request. Based on an opensource web application deployed in a hosting company, we will analyze manyopen source software that composes a web request.

    Using Chromium as the user browser, we will understand what it does when a URLis typed and how it resolves the domain. DNS and UDP protocols will beexplained in order to get the server IP. The IP received from DNS will be usedto create a TCP connection to the server and we will understand how the three-way handshake works for that matter. Instead of using only the HTTP protocol,this connection will use HTTPS and we will analyze the TLS handshake as well.

    From the user local network to the hosting server, there are many routes tofollow and we will analyze some of them. Getting to the server we willunderstand how the web server receives the request and forward to the webapplication. Web application talks to the web framework and your applicationthat creates the HTML response. Everything will be assembled and return to theweb browser that will process and render everything.

    Throughout the entire process, we will point to open source code wheneverpossible.

    ## Audience

    Everyone that knows a little bit about internet and has done some developmentfor the it

    Kube is beautiful, modern communication in a reliable, high-performance nativegroupware application for your desktop, laptop and mobile devices

    Kube is a next-gen communication and collaboration client built with QtQuickon top of a high performance, low resource usage core. It provides online andoffline access to all your mail, contacts, calendars, notes, todo's and more.

    With a strong focus on usability, the team works with designers and UX expertsfrom the ground up, to build a product that is not only visually appealing butalso a joy to use.

    While the initial focus is on Linux, the desktop and email, the platform isbuilt to run on all desktop systems as well as on mobile devices. It willeventually evolve into a full collaboration client including contacts,calendars, notes, todos, instant messaging etc.

    This talk is giving an overview of what Kube is and strives to be, along withsome history why this effort has been started in the first place.

    The talk will go into some technical detail, but is suitable for anyoneinterested in an alternative to the currently existing groupware clients.

    As subsurface evolved from a Gtk Application to a Qt one, cutting a quarter ofthe codebase while still gaining new functionalities, a new developmentproposal was done: "How do we get this desktop based application and run it onmobile, on a unified codebase?"

    How do we get a kernel developer application writed in kernel-style code forthe desktop and make it universal, running in any operating system, mobile anddesktop?

    On this talk I'll present you piece-by-piece history on what we had whenSubsurface started, the chalenges that kernel hackers faced when creating adesktop application and why the choice was made to port away from Gtk into Qt- even tougth the main developer of subsurface back then loathed C++.

    After the initial port to Desktop a new era began, the era of MobileApplications, and Qt had launched it's new Qml language that promissed goodintegration on mobile and even desktop with minimal effort. We wanted to giveit a try. At the same time the KDE hackers launched a new idea "Kirigami", alibrary build on Qml to simplify development of Qml based software, and sincewe where already on the bleeding edge of things, why not give it a try?

    This is the tale of Subsurface, From Gtk to Qt to Mobile, from one of it'smain hackers.

    Libertine is an application suite for installing and running classicapplications in a confined environment. Using libertine allows us to useeveryday applications which have not been ported over to a new packagingformat or don't work natively with a new display server. Libertine has allowedus to take advantage of classic apps such as Firefox and LibreOffice in UbuntuTouch, a version of Ubuntu for devices based on click packaging andMir/Unity8. Ubuntu developers have recently unveiled snappy, a new kind ofpackaging system which keeps an application confined to a readonly filesystemwith all of its dependencies managed internally. Since migrating applicationsto snaps is a manual process, we've been working on a libertine snap to giveus the ability to use non-snap applications in an all-snaps Ubuntu.

    This lecture will start with an overview of why libertine is a necessarycomponent for managing and launching deb-based applications on both a classicMir/Unity8 system and a completely confined all-snaps Ubuntu. Then there willbe a review of how libertine works in general through container management andapplication launching. Finally, these topics will come together with anexplanation of the infrastructure required for libertine to operate in an all-snaps environment. There will be light code and tooling examples throughout,as well as a live demonstration of deb-based X applications running in a snapenvironment.

    This talk will highlight the lessons learned from creating Zorin OS and theZorin Desktop environment, how various optimisations have made our Linuxdesktop even more approachable and how the wider community can work togetherto spread the power of Linux to new classes of users around the world.

    Over the past 25 years Linux has slowly dominated nearly every class of device– from the ubiquitous smartphone to the servers that run the world. However,the desktop computer has remained the elusive form factor for Linux.

    The Linux desktop has matured over the years to be more user-friendly, but ithas yet to fully cross the threshold to become a true mainstream platform. Isthis because we need to work more on the technology, or is it that we need toask ourselves different questions about the goals behind our FLOSS desktopprojects?

    Nix is a package manager providing a number of unique features to automatedeployments in a reliable and reproducible way. It serves as the basis of theNixOS Linux distribution (that can be automatically installed from a singledeclarative specification), as well as a number of additional deploymentsolutions, such as NixOps, that deploys virtual machines in the cloud andHydra: the Nix-based continuous integration server. Although Nix offers allkinds of deployment benefits, integration with language-specific packagemanagers that also do dependency management, such as the NPM package manager,is problematic as they conflict with Nix's reliability properties. In thispresentation, I will show `node2nix`, a tool that automatically generates Nixexpressions (build recipes) from an NPM package's `package.json` configurationfile, allowing users to deploy NPM packages with the Nix package mangeralongside other types of packages (e.g. Autotools, Perl, Python, ...) thatconstitute a large complex system.

    In this talk I try to address the following target audience:

      * System administrators/DevOps:     * people who typically deploy entire software systems in which parts of them might be Node.js applications    * NPM makes it less convenient to use a single intergrated deployment solution, e.g. you might need to use both NPM and the host system's package manager + additional scripts    * solution requires on external distribution channels  * Distro packagers:     * Some types of software are hard to package and as a result difficult to include with e.g. a Linux distribution    * Especially if source package uses a system that does both build and dependency management    * The Dependency manager conflicts with the host system's package manager and might use inferior technology    * Besides NPM, Apache Maven is also a prominent example  * Node.js developers:     * Many Node developers are not aware of some of NPM's dependency management implications    * Good to raise awareness  * Package manager developers (e.g. the NPM devs):     * Virtually every modern programming language/environment has its own (language-specific) package manager    * Lessons learned are important for everybody

    Following the progress of the Modularity initiative and Factory 2.0developments in Fedora, it's about time we define what the next, modularoperating system should look like, focusing on the developer’s point of view.

    This first half of this talk will present the main concepts of Modularity,explaining in detail what modules are, how they get built, composed,distributed and kept updated once deployed on the target system.

    The second half of the talk will explore the idea of the so-calledGenerational Core, often also referred to as Base Runtime — a modular platformbase on top of which application modules can both be built and executed.

    Both these topics cover ongoing efforts and we don’t yet have definitiveanswers to all the questions. We’ll talk about what we learned in the pastyear, what problems we’re trying to solve and our plans for the future.

    Part of our job as package maintainers in various distributions is to ensurethe binary packages can be built from the corresponding source code. This isoften a requirement, either from a distribution's own policies (eg, the DFSGfor Debian), or from the license of the upstream package (eg, the GPL). Butalthough we are used to seeing .c and .py files as source, we sometimes forgetthat our packages are built from many other files for which we also must makethe source available.

    In this talk I will explain why we require source code in the first place;without the availability of source code, the whole free software ecosystemwould not exist. I will also describe file types that we sometimes forget tosee as source, or which are considered binary but we forget to include thesource code for. This includes documentation, build scripts, files generatedat build time by various programs, fonts, multimedia such as sound, music,images and even video. I will also describe various problems we can encounterwhen trying to determine what the actual source is, and that even if we knowwhat the source is, that it is sometimes creates practical problems fordistributions to include all of it.

    To publish it's documentation, SUSE has developed not only a comprehensiveOpen Source toolchain to create and publish documentation but also an openworkflow that allows community and partners to provide feedback andcontribute. These tools and processes can easily be adopted by other projectsto write high quality software documentation.

    SUSE has been around as Linux vendor for a long time and from it's early daysonwards, delivered not only software but also the documentation to use it. Infact, SUSE is not only writing the documentation for it's own distributionsbut for upstream projects like OpenStack as well. Over time, the SUSEdocumentation team has developed not only a comprehensive, completely Free andOpen Source toolchain to create, edit, manage, and publish documentation butalso an open workflow that allows community and partners to provide feedbackand contribute. These tools and processes can easily be adopted by otherprojects to write high quality software documentation, everything from a manpage to a reference guide.

    While small updates normally don't disturb the services running on yoursystem, bigger or intrusive updates can break your running services orDesktop. There are different ways of doing transactional updates like newpackage formats or different partitions. This talk will show how to use thefeatures of btrfs for this with traditional package managers.

    Applying small updates is normally no problem in a running system. But whatabout if there is a new major release of your favorite Desktop? Or a majorversion update of your used Linux distribution? Today’s concepts are most ofthe time to apply the patches in the running system and risk that a runningservice or Desktop breaks, or apply them all by booting an installation mediaand wait for quite some time until you can access your machine again. Asolution for this are transactional updates.

    Transactional updates are atomic, means either they applied successful, or ifan error occurred, you have the same state as before. And if an update doesnot work, there is an easy way to go back to the last working state.

    There are different solutions for this, some require new package formats,other require a second partition and you can switch during the next reboot tothe other partition. I want to present a third solution: using a standardpackage manager and leverage btrfs for this. With snapshots and rollback onbtrfs, there is already everything available what you need. This talk willgive a short introduction into snapshots and rollback with btrfs and show howto combine and use this technologies to your advantage.

    After the OpenStack Tokyo Summit in november 2015, the RDO communitytransitioned to a delivery workflow inspired by OpenStack's own continuousintegration infrastructure ("OpenStack Infra"). The platform relies onSoftware Factory (https://softwarefactory-project.io/) to set up automaticallythe tools from OpenStack Infra together, and a few additional tools specificto RDO to ensure the quality of their packages. In this presentation, we willintroduce the main components of RDO's delivery platform, the problems theyhelp solve, and how they can be adapted to set up your own "RPM Factory".

    Benefits: if you're making a distribution, this is the point of view of theupstream package makers. Why are distribution statistics important to us? Dowe monitor your bugs system or do you have a better escalation to us? How dowe test to make sure things are going well before release. This and more willbe spoken about.

    As an upstream project (package), we love nothing more than being availableeverywhere. But time and energy goes into making this is so as there arequirks in every distribution.

    Six years after having forked the commercial Mandriva Linux distribution andwith five solid releases, the Mageia community wants to share its successesand lessons learned from developing, releasing and supporting a user-friendlyand flexible distribution with an inclusive governance model. Mageia's aim isto bridge the gap between end users and developers, encouraging andfacilitating contributions from all users thanks to low entry barriers andmentoring programs in its various teams.

    * * *

    The 100% community-driven GNU/Linux distribution Mageia was forked from thethen-unsteady (and now defunct) commercial distribution Mandriva Linux 6 yearsago, in September 2010. Since then, the volunteers from the Mageia communityhave published 5 stable releases, with the 6th one in the making, alwaysfocusing on bridging the gap between end users and contributors, to create auser-friendly but powerful system made for and by its users.

    Forking a commercial distribution with paid staff to run it as a community-driven non-profit endeavour relying solely on volunteers was an ambitious move– with the perspective of those 6 years of development, the Mageia communitywould like to present the lessons learned, the hardships and successes it hador still has and its plans to continue progressing forward as a community-based independent GNU/Linux distribution.

    The talk will aim at outlining general conclusions that could be relevantbeyond the scope of GNU/Linux distributions, and therefore provide usefulinsights for other projects transitioning from a company-driven development topartial or full community focus.

    _Speakers:_

    **Anne Nicolas** is one of the founders of Mageia, and since then active aspackagers team leader, member of the Mageia Council and chairwoman ofMageia.org's Board (non-profit association representing the community'sinterests). She is responsible for building ISO images for stable anddevelopment releases. She is also of former employee of Mandriva SA and knewwell the development and governance of Mandriva Linux.

    **Samuel Verschelde** was a long time end user and occasional contributor ofMandriva Linux when the fork was initiated in 2010. He then decided to jointhe adventure and to get more involved in the development of his system ofchoice. He is most active in the bug triage and quality assurance teams, whichhe helped organise and led several times. He is also a member of the MageiaCouncil and the Mageia.org Board.

Thissession will explain how and why openSUSE Tumbleweed is paving the way forthat future, while already being "the reliable rolling release". The talk willdispel the fears, uncertainties and doubts that many have regarding rollingreleases in general and Tumbleweed specifically, and share how you can getinvolved both using, and improving, this exciting fast moving foundation ofthe openSUSE Project.

    The audience is anyone interested in using recent versions of the Linux kernelor other upstream projects. This includes not only enthusiasts, butdevelopers, especially Linux kernel developers and other developers of fastmoving stacks who often benefit from having a stable platform with all thelatest libraries and binaries available to them. Attendees can expect to get asolid understanding of how Tumbleweed is developed, it's strengths andbenefits, as well as a comparison with Tumbleweed to other similar Linux-basedrolling distributions. This presentation will encourage a broader adoption ofrolling releases and the mentality, methodologies and capabilities that comewith it. Tumbleweed and other similar rolling releases are key platforms toenable the high speed development of the Linux kernel and other key ecosystemcomponents which increasingly move at a faster pace than 'traditional' Linuxdistributions can keep up. Rolling releases are also the natural platform fornot only the development but the early adoption of key emerging technologiessuch as Containerisation and NFV.

    What's a "system service"? How do we model that in GuixSD?

    In most people’s mind, system services are a bunch of daemons that simply needto be started at boot time, or whenever they are actually needed. Possiblyservices form a dependency graph, and possibly they are actions other thanspawning a daemon, such as mounting a file system.

    As always, the devil is in the detail, and reality is that “system services”on a modern GNU/Linux system—with udev, dbus, polkit, along with moretraditional Unix services—include lots of different “activities”, with lots ofinteractions among them. That naive picture of a graph of services no longerworks.

    This talk is going to tell the story of system services in GuixSD. GuixSDstarted from the naive visions of a “dependency graph of actions” to evolveinto a generic model of service composition. I will describe what makesGuixSD’s service composition model unique, and how it helps users andsysadmins reason about the whole system.

    Kamailio is an open source SIP (RFC3261) server that can be used for buildingreal time communications systems for IP telephony, instant messaging orpresence. Seeral years ago it introduced a Lua embedded interpreter to allowmore flexibility in routing calls. Recently, it was extended to allow entireRTC routing logic to be written in Lua. This talk focuses on showing theinsights of implementing the LUA RTC API in Kamailio, tips and tricksdiscovered to make it as fast as the native pre-compiled routing language, andthe benefits it bring to enhance RTC systems and integrate with third partyservices, such as social networking platforms (e.g., sending a Twitter DM on amissed call).

    Real time communications has evolved at a fast pace in the last decade. Fromwhat it used to be direct voice calls or testing via classic or mobiletelephony, nowadays everyone connects through a multitude of channels,dedicated messaging systems or other social media channels. Kamailio is anopen source SIP server developed since 2001, with an initial focus onscalability for IP telephony services. To allow more flexibility and easierintegration with other RTC services, an embedded LUA interpreter was added toit and with a recent development, the entire SIP routing logic can be writtenin Lua. The presentation will reveal insights of implementing the LUA RTC APIin Kamailio, tips and tricks discovered to make it as fast as the native pre-compiled routing language, and the benefits it bring to enhance RTC systemsand integrate with third party services, such as social networking platforms(e.g., sending a Twitter DM on a missed call).

    A look at how HTTP/2 has improved the web, which cases that are stillproblematic and what's being done about it next. Will there be a QUIC fix?

    A recap on what HTTP/2 brought that HTTP/1 couldn't offer before we dig in andlook at some numbers that show how HTTP/2 has improved (browser) networkingand the web experience for people.

    Still, there are scenarios where HTTP/1's multiple connections win over HTTP/2in performance tests. Why is that and what is being done about it? Wasn'tHTTP/2 supposed to be the silver bullet?

    A closer look at QUIC, its promises to fix the areas where HTTP/2 didn'tdeliver and a check on where it is today. Is QUIC perhaps actually HTTP/3 ineverything but the name?

    A community building project around the Firefox Nightly Channel

    Every day, we compile the code for Firefox on our master branch, mozilla-central, and generate builds without the Firefox branding, those are calledFirefox Nightly build. Until recently, those builds were barely mentionned orpromoted on mozilla.org, localized versions existed but were only known to thelocalizers themselves, the download page was on a separate domain and hadn'tbeen redesigned since 2011.

    As a result, we have very few Firefox Nightly users.

    What would be the impact for Mozilla if Firefox Nightly became a first-classcitizen among Firefox channels? How about getting back more technical users onthis channel reporting bugs as they get introduced into our codebase insteadof weeks or months later? Could we ship faster and better quality software ifwe had an army of Nightly testers reporting regressions and giving theirfeedback on a daily basis? How about engaging our existing community of power-users directly into the production process for Firefox as a long termparticipation project?

    This talk is a recap of what the release management team has been working onin the last 8 months to turn the nightly channel in a more useful toolleveraging our existing community to ship a better Firefox and what we expectto do in 2017 around the nightly channel to serve our QA needs.

    Diversity User Research: Becoming a Better Listener - Gloria Dwomoh

    In order to understand the struggles and/or challenges of minorities in techand foster a safe environment for their inclusion, we need to be betterlisteners. One way we are able to get access to the voice of our users isthrough user research. However in order to increase effective communication weneed to learn the art of listening. Several of us were taught to speak, readand write, but we simply assume we know how to listen. There is a saying thatless than 2% of people have had any formal education on how to listen, whilethat is a skill that many of us use in our daily lives. Through this talk wewill understand the difference between hearing and listening; we will alsoexplore active listening and how it can better help us in our user research.

    Women in Open Source Technologies - Kristi Progri

    The Gender Gap is one of the most talked topic since forever, and still a Gap.Where are the women in Open Source? Why is the gap so big? Women participationin open technology and culture is very important so we should all pay moreattention. This talk will be focused on the large steps we can take to reducethis gap. Also we will share out experience at our hackerspace in Tirana,Albania since we have lots of women there.

    Let's face it: Gender Diversity in Tech is in a quite bad shape. The sad thingabout it is that it's even more noticeable in many Open Source communities inparticular. But why is gender diversity important?

    It’s not just diversity for the sake of diversity. If men and women areequally intelligent, statistically speaking, then out of the smartest tenpeople in the world, five should be male and five should be female. Thus, ifyour team is anything less than an equal balance of men and women, then yourteam is probably not the best it can be.

    Unfortunately, if we take a look at a random sample from GitHub activecontributors from 2015, just 5.4% of GitHub users with over 10 contributionsare female.

    Let's talk about the ways we can fix this and what efforts Mozilla does toimprove this and how you can help Mozilla help the community, concretely withWomoz (Women at Mozilla) and the Diversity & Inclusion Team at Mozilla.

    C has been the _de facto_ systems programming language for decades, so hugeamounts of useful programs and libraries are written in that language. NewRust code can make use of that legacy of work via FFI, but to get the fulladvantages of Rust, legacy software needs to be re-written in Rust. Corrode isa tool to semi-automate these rewrites by producing Rust source that behavesexactly like the original C, enabling developers to focus on the interestingparts of improving code quality.

    Join us as we demonstrate how Mozilla are using Selenium to test Firefox byextending the WebDriver specification.

    Selenium is a popular tool for testing websites across multiple browsers, andwhen combined with Mozilla's implementation of the WebDriver specification, itbecomes possible to interact directly with Firefox itself. In this session,we'll show a simple approach to writing tests using Selenium in Python, andthen demonstrate how we're taking this further to replace our existingfunctional UI tests for Firefox. By using Selenium, we're hoping to makecontributing to these tests much easier for our community, and by pushing thetools to their limits we'll also make them rock solid.

    After nearly a decade, the European Commission has presented its draft law forcopyright reform. And it’s about time: our copyright laws are out of step withtoday’s technology. But the proposal to reform copyright lacks ambition, andis inadequate to address the today’s challenges. It even contains some verydangerous provisions - such as a snippet tax, and upload filters for onlineplatforms - that would put the open internet, innovation, and creativity, atgreat risk. This session will unpack some of the key issues at stake in thereform and how you can get involved. Together we can achieve an EU copyrightreform that fosters innovation and creativity.

    The Rust project has become a large software development project. To betterunderstand how it is being developed, a software development analyticsdashboard has been deployed for it. This dashboard tracks most of the publicdata about Rust development, and allows to visualize, drill down andunderstand that data. The talk will present this dashboard, and how to use itto learn about the details of Rust development processes and community. Itwill also present some interesting data obtained from it.

    The Rust software development dashboard visualizes data obtained from somesystems used to support Rust development: git, GitHub, StackOverflow... Thedata related to Rust is retrieved from them, stored, organized an massaged ina database, and later visualized in the dashboard. The dashboard allows notonly to browse the data, but also to drill down and play with it. This way,any person interested in how Rust is being developed can have both an generaloverview, or very detailed views of the community and processes involved. Thedashboard permits to track activity (in commits, issues, pull requests,questions and answers, etc.), actors (who is creating the code, who is fixingbugs, who is answering questions), and processes (hot long does it take toclose issues, or to accept pull requests).

    The Rust Development Dashbard has been deployed using GriomoireLab, ancomplete FOSS system for retrieving data from software developmentrepositories, storing it, and producing different kinds of analytics,dashboards and reports.

    The talk will present the different kind of information that can be obtainedfrom the dashboard, and how to interact with it for finding any detail ofinterest. Several specific aspects of Rust development will be presented aswell, so that people attending may expect to finish the talk with a betterunderstanding of how Rust is being developed. The talk will also provide hintson how to exploit the data behind the dashboard to obtain specificinformation.

    Mozilla's SpiderMonkey library can be used to embed JavaScript in any C++projects. It is quite easy to expose some simple bindings and get a "helloworld" application running in no-time.

    However, after this first hello world, you'll quickly notice that you'll needother features such as timer, networking, file access, threading or evengraphics and audio. At this point things get much more complicated, andmaintaning the bindings can quickly become overwhelming.

    Our team has been creating such bindings for SpiderMonkey since 2007 inseveral projects and this talk will present best practices, tips and caveatsthat we have learned over the years. We will also see how to make embedderslife easier by using nidium library that bundles many basic bindings, in thehope that more developers can use the power of SpiderMonkey in a convienientway.

    Positioning in robotics has alway been a challenge. For outdoor, robots GPS issolving most of the practical problems, but indoor, precise localization isstill done using expensive proprietary systems mainly based on an array ofcameras.

    In this talk, I will present the loco positioning system: an open source UltraWide Band radio-based local positioning system, why we need it and how itworks. I will also speak about its usage with the Crazyflie 2.0 open sourcenano quadcopter, of course ending with an autonomous flying demo.

    I am Arnaud Taffanel, co-founder of Bitcraze. Bitcraze is designing and makingthe Crazyflie 2.0 nano quadcopter, a flying open source development platform.We are designing, making and selling hardware platforms and releasing allsoftware as open source projects on Github.

    From the beginning of the Crazyflie project, when it was still an after-workfun project, we were dreaming of a Local Positioning System that would allowsus to fly the quadcopter autonomously. For years, the only viable solutionswhere very expensive camera-based motion capture systems. We have beenassisting researchers using the Crazyflie with this kind of system but it wasout of our reach and out of reach for most of the community.

    About a year ago, we discovered that a company, Decawave, had released anultra-wide-band radio module that would allows us to build an LocalPositioning System for a fraction of the price of the motion captures system.This became the Loco Positioning System and it is still under heavydevelopment with the help the community. The Loco Positioning System hardwarehas been released last summer in "early access" which means that the hardwarewas finished and tested but that much of the software and algorithm were stillunder development.

    We now have a flying system. With the help of researchers and industrials, weare starting to have state-of-the art algorithm for position estimation andautonomous flight. Currently the main users for the LPS and Crazyflie areuniversities for research and education, technical artists for shows andindustrials for research and tech demos. In the future, technologies andalgorithm developed for the LPS will be used for even-more affordablepositioning system (for example based on webcams) to allow anyone to play withautonomous flying platforms.

    LAVA and Fuego are great tools individually already. Combining and extendingthem allows for a much broader test coverage than each tool alone can provide.In this presentation, Jan-Simon Möller will present the features of thecombined infrastructure and highlight the tools and work done to integrateboth tools. Also in focus is how to distribute the test infrastructure acrossmultiple sites to include more boards. In the end we'll discuss the lessonslearned and future developments.

    The focus of this talk is to share the experiences made and lessons learned soppl can integrate such tools better in their own environment. It also raisesthe pain-points and open issues when setting up a distributed environment.

    Especially for Automotive, Long-Term-Support, CIP or Consumer Electronics,advancing the Test-harness is essential to raise the bar and strengthen theconfidence in our embedded platforms. Automated testing can improve ourecosystem from two sides: during development (feature does work _and_ does notbreak things) and during maintenance (no regressions through backports).

    In this talk, I will give an introduction into the QtWayland Compositorframework and show how to use it to create a Wayland compositor from scratch.The QtWayland Compositor API is rather new and just got its first stablerelease with Qt 5.8. It can be used to create Wayland compositors from scratchwithin only a few hours and completely adapt them to the UI concept of yourembedded device. My talk focus on how to use the framework within a complexmulti-application automotive scenario.

    Wayland is today's standard to perform window compositing on embedded Linuxdevices. In cars, one typically uses the automotive specific "IVI" protocolextension to talk to the compositor. This works well if you have a UI withonly limited window dynamics or animations, like a static display of windowsfrom different processes (e.g. display consisting of a radio control window, aclimate control window...). But if you want to add fancy window animationsand/or have a certain complex workflow for your UI in mind, the IVI protocolshows its limits. However, writing your own Wayland compositor is no option insuch a case due to the amount of work and the introduced complexity/bugs. Inthis talk, I will explain why and when the QtWayland Compositor Frameworkprovides you with a new alternative.

    The QtWayland Compositor API, which only recently entered the realm of stablereleased Qt API, makes it almost trivial to create your own Waylandcompositor. Even adding your own protocol extensions, for which your UXdesigners can add any fancy (QtQuick) animation you can dream of, is simple.In my talk, I will give an introduction into the QtWayland Compositorframework and show how to use it to create a Wayland compositor from scratch.I will focus on my own experience as an embedded device developer from usingthe framework in real-life automotive scenarios. However, like most people inthe embedded world, I cannot directly talk about my projects, but instead willtalk about a hypothetical "Kitchen HMI" project, which yet will cover the fullcomplexity of a multi-application device. Specifically, this Kitchen HMI willfeature the following:

      * The windows from different example applications (clock app, tea cooking timer app, egg cooking timer app) will be composed in a uniform UI by a QtWayland based Wayland compositor.  * The compositor provides a custom protocol extension for alarming ("hey, your tea is ready!").  * The windows will have nice animations, actually you can handle them the same as QtQuick items in the canvas of a QtQuick application.

    Attending the talk will provide you with the required knowledge to do all ofthe above on your own and specifically show that window handling in aQtWayland compositor "feels" the same like doing simple declarative QtQuick UIdevelopment.

    System-on-Chip vendors typically provide a board support package (BSP) whichshould be a good starting point to develop the software for an embedded Linuxsystem. However they often seem to misunderstand what the software designerswant, and deliver something that makes their life harder without any apparentbenefit.

    In this talk Luca will share some of his experiences with such vendor BSPs,featuring jurassic kernels, non-working drivers, non-existing bootloaders,code of appallingly bad quality, ineffective customer support and Windows-onlytools.

    You will discover why he spent weeks in understanding, fixing and workingaround BSPs instead of just using them. The effects on the final productquality will be described as well.

    Luca will also discuss what the options are when you face such a BSP, and whatboth hackers and vendors can do to improve the situation for everybody'sbenefit.

Todemonstrate that the kernel has achieved suitable reliability and correctnessproperties basic metrics of such properties and their statistic analysis canbe used as part of the argument. Linux has a wealth of analytical tools built-in to it which allow to extract information on compliance, robustness ofdevelopment, as well as basic metrics on complexity or correctness withrespect to defined properties. While IEC 61508 Ed 2 always pairs testing andanalysis, we believe that for a high complexity system traditional testing isof relatively low effectiveness and analytical methods need to be the primarypath. To this ends we outline some approaches taken:

      * Bug-age analysis  * Bug-rates and trend analysis  * Code-complexity/bug relationship  * Brain-dead correctness analysis  * Interface and type-correctness analysis  * API compliance analysis  * Analysis of build-bot data

    While much of the data points to robust and mature code there also are someareas where problems popped up. In this talk we outline the used methods andgive examples as well as key findings. FLOSS development has reached a quiteimpressive maturity, to substantially go beyond we think it will need the useof quantitative process and code metrics - these results from SIL2LinuxMP maybe a starting point.

    This fall my team launched the Open Source Car Control (OSCC) project, a by-wire control kit that makes autonomous vehicle development accessible andcollaborative to developers at every level. In this presentation, we discussthe project and its implications on the development of autonomous cars in avertically integrated and traditionally closed industry.

    A primary barrier to entry in autonomous vehicle development is gaining accessto a car that can be controlled with an off-the-shelf computer. Purchasingfrom an integrator can cost upwards of $100K, and DIY endeavors can result inunreliable and unsafe solutions. The OSCC project acts as a solution to theseproblems. OSCC is a kit of open hardware and software (based on Arduino) thatcan be used to take control of the throttle, brake, and steering in moderncars. The result is a fully by-wire test car that can be built for about $10K(USD), including the vehicle. In this discussion, we unpack the impetus anddevelopment of the OSCC project, challenges we encountered during development,and the role projects like OSCC have in a necessary “flattening” of theautomotive industry.

    When the Ingress game started in 2013, quite a few people world-wide found outthat augmented reality gaming in the real world was a great new invention, andthe game grew to become a success for the then-project inside Google. With itsPokémon themed update in 2016, Niantic got the whole world playing - andsponsoring them with all their personal details. Veripeditus opens up theworld of AR game creation to the public.

    The Pokémon Go hype is spreading and more and more people are playing - on areal map with real objects. With the ever growing possibilities of smartphones and apps, interest for Augmented Reality is getting bigger. But thereare obvious problems: current developers don't care about privacy and data iscollected, sold and freely provided to others at will.

    About time to make a change! Veripeditus is entirely free, open sourcesoftware and easy to use. The server can be run entirely by yourself andeveryone can develope games and custom clients if they wish. The frameworkdallows for the development of augmented reality games, so called "cartridges",that can be played in the real world in any scope, be it locally, like on thepremises of a museum, or on global scope, like an augemented reality MMORPG.

    In the development of Veripeditus, we aim at making game development as easyas possible. The only thing needed is basic knowledge of Python and, ofcourse, ideas for the game. Veripeditus itself also employs basic, well-knowntechnologies like a relational database, the SQLAlchemy object-relationalmapper and a (glorified) RESTful API.

    This talk will give an introduction to how Veripeditus was developed, howgames can be created and what can be done with it - some ideas include usingVeripeditus in education, local group activities, tourism amd, of course,plain fun gaming.

    We will also showcase a mini game that will be playable on the ULB campus!

    Libreboot is free/opensource boot firmware for laptops, desktops and servers,on multiple platforms and architectures. It replaces the proprietary BIOS/UEFIfirmware commonly foundin computers.

    Libreboot is a free/opensource boot firmware implementation for laptops,desktops and servers, on ARM and x86 (POWER8 and POWER9 is planned). Itreplaces the proprietary BIOS/UEFI firmware found in most PCs. We believe thatthis is an important goal to aim for, for reasons of security, privacy andfreedom in the user's computing, where, if we are successful and thrive, morepeople can use systems which do not have malicious anti-features, invasivebackdoors and other nasty quirks introduced by most modern proprietaryfirmware.

    Libreboot started in December 2013, as a response to the lack of other similarprojects. Its goal was (and is) to provide an easy way for the public toaccess free, libre computing. This includes the boot firmware, operatingsystem, drivers, applications and everything else.

    It is based on coreboot, but we are also interested in using other projects asupstreams aswell, for other hardware. Libreboot is currently expanding, withan explosion of new hardware support on the horizon.

    Libreboot was also a GNU project, for a brief period, but it voluntarily leftthe GNU project over a fundamental disagreement with the FSF, regarding theiremployment practises. Libreboot is now its own independent project once more,with its own community and infrastructure.

    The libreboot project is always looking for more people to get involved,especially skilled hardware hackers (companies welcome) who have experience orknowledge in low-level firmware development.

    Libreboot is funded by Minifree, which sells systems with Libreboot and Debianpreinstalled. https://minifree.org/

    Never before it was so easy and inexpensive to gather, as well as generate,massive amounts of data. Often, data get discretized in space and time,nat­ur­ally leading to multi-dimensional arrays. In fact, arrays play a corerole in most domains of science, engineering, and bus­in­ess - generallyspeak­ing, spatio-temporal sensor, image, time­series, sim­­ul­ation, andstatistics data­. This raises the need for flexible, scalable, and openservices in replacement of the bespoke silo solutions that have prevailed inthe past.

    Traditional databases have been successful due to their flexibility (throughquery languages) and scalability (through manifold optimizations andparallelization in the server) - however, they unfortunately do not supportmassive arrays. This is being remedied within ISO currently where SQL/MDA("Multi-Dimensional Arrays") is in an advanced stage, likely becoming adoptedin summer 2017. SQL/MDA adds declarative array definition and operations toSQL. Not only paves this the way for powerful services, maybe even moreimportant it allows, for the first time, integrating data and metadata intothe same archive, even in one and the same query. As such, SQL/MDA will be agame changer in data services not only for science and engineering at large.

    We present the concepts and rationales, as well as the open-source technologyrasdaman ("raster data manager") which is serving as the blueprint for MDA.

    We have learnt to live with the pain of separating data and metadata into non-interoperable silos. For metadata, we enjoy the flexibility of databases, bethey relational, graph, or some other NoSQL. Contrasting this, users still"drown in files" as an unstructured, low-level archiving paradigm. It is timeto bridge this chasm which once was technologically induced, but today can beovercome.

    One building block towards a common re-integrated information space is tosupport massive multi-dimensional spatio-temporal arrays. These "datacubes"appear as sensor, image, simulation, and statistics data in all science andengineering domains, and beyond. For example, 2-D satellilte imagery, 2-Dx/y/t image timeseries and x/y/z geophysical voxel data, and 4-D x/y/z/tclimate data contribute to today's data deluge in the Earth sciences. Virtualobservatories in the Space sciences routinely generate Petabytes of such data.Life sciences deal with microarray data, confocal microscopy, human braindata, which all fall into the same category.

    The ISO SQL/MDA (Multi-Dimensional Arrays) candidate standard is extending SQLwith modelling and query support for n-D arrays ("datacubes") in a flexible,domain-neutral way. This heralds a new generation of services with new qualityparameters, such as flexibility, ease of access, embedding into well-knownuser tools, and scalability mechanisms that remain completely transparent tousers. Technology like the EU rasdaman ("raster data manager") Array Databasesystem can support all of the above examples simultaneously, with onetechnology. This is practically proven: As of today, rasdaman is inoperational use on hundreds of Terabytes of satellite image timeseriesdatacubes, with transparent query distribution across more than 1,000 nodes.

    Therefore, Array Databases offering SQL/MDA constitute a natural commonbuilding block for next-generation data infrastructures. Being initiator andeditor of the standard we present principles, implementation facets, andapplication examples as a basis for further discussion. Time allowing we willpresent live demos from services exceeding 20 TB of "datacubes".

    Everyone is excited about the The Internet of Things (IoT) and thepossibilities of really seeing the democratization of the internet, devicesfor everyone needs, not just a few! If we are to achieve, then these devicesmust be design and built by everyone, we must create a Zine like industry,beyond the current makers of today, to enable people of all ages, gender(including non-binary), and race, to build devices suited to their own needs.LoRaWAN is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification intended forwireless battery operated Things in regional, national or global networks.LoRaWAN target key requirements of Internet of Things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services.

    In this talk, I will introduce LoRaWAN as a key radio technology for IoT andwalk through why it is a technologically important development as I show howto build LoRaWAN node applications to explore the possibility of IoT. Thereare a number of LoRaWAN networks emerging across Europe and I will highlightthe political importance of why these networks should be open, supporting OpenData and Open Science and empowering the development of a new set applicationdomains.

    The lecture will involve a demonstration of an LoRaWAN application that willshowcase the both the node and Gateway aspects of a deployed network.

    Soon, everything on Earth will be connected via peer-to-peer networking and/orthe public Internet, with a multitude of sensor-driven devices dramaticallychanging our lives and our environment. These devices will be based on a widevariety of devices, ranging from tiny (e.g., microcontrollers) to huge (e.g.,cloud servers), with one thing in common: they will require a radio connectionto a Gateway that is connected to the internet, in some form or another. WhileBluetooth LE or even Wi-fi might be used around the "smart" house or within alimited range, the battery limitations of the later and the range limitationsof the former mean it is unlikely that these standards will form the backboneof a IoT network.

    For IoT there are a number of competing radio standards, e.g. LoRa and SigFox,both are long range and provide the ability to build nodes that are very low-power, with a potential battery life of 2 or more years, while providing along range, often in access of 10km. A key feature of these standards is theyare low-bandwidth, often each message is limited to 100 or so bytes, forSigFox even less. Each standard has its drawbacks but SigFox requires moreexpensive chipsets for the Gateway side of things, which is not the case forLoRa, and as such this has seen the development of community, crowd sourced,LoRa networks, based on LoRaWAN. One example of this is The Things Network,who community has been developing Gateways, nodes, cloud backends, andsoftware to run on these, all open source, supporting open data and openscience. In Bristol we are deploying a LoRaWAN network built on existingwireless infrastructure locations, provided by Bristol Wireless.

    In this lecture I will introduce LoRaWAN from a technical perspective,providing examples, and also look at the IoT and LoRaWAN networks from apolitical perspective.

    I will bring a portable LoRaWAN network that we have developed at theUniversity of West of England, mostly for testing radio capabilities but alsoallowing us to demo LoRaWAN and IoT on the move, and also some example nodes,some of which will be used by the audience. This will demonstrate the use ofThe Things Network backend infrastructure to provide an internet backend andbring the internet part of Internet of Things. We will provide demos that theaudience will be able to interact with during the session and see the resultslive during the talk.

    Continuous integration brought us fast reliable and continuous testing.Continuous localisation brings the same speed and delivery to the translationof software. We'll look at how to build such a process using FOSS tools.

    Continuous localisation is becoming more critical to the software deliveryprocess. And just like continuous inegration we rely on a number of tools andautomation to ensure that we deliver good translations quickly to products.

    We'll be looking at continuous localisation processes using FOSS tools andmapping the parallels between modern software development and continuouslocalisation.

    We'll cover aspects such as:

      * Testing/Checking and building automated linguistic and stylistic checks  * Automated and bidirectional synchronisation between the translation tools and software repos  * Building in processes for content review both in source and target text  * Encouraging translator participation  * Delivering translations quickly and continuously

    And for FOSS projects we'll show how to implement a process using FOSS tools.

    The Machine is a hardware project at Hewlett Packard Enterprise which takes anew look at computer architecture. With many processors and large amounts ofdirectly addressable storage, The Machine program has offered an equally largeopportunity for developing new system software. Our team at HPE has spent thebetter part of two years writing new software and adapting existing softwareto expose the capabilities of the hardware to application developers.

    Taking off from my presentation at LCA 2016, this presentation will explorethe changes we've made throughout the Linux environment, from securityinfrastructure to new file systems.

    As directly addressable storage is such a large part of the new hardware, thispresentation will focus on a couple of important bits of free software whichexpose that to applications, including our Librarian File System and ManagedData Structures libraries.

    Managed Data Structures introduces a new application programming paradigmwhere the application works directly on the stable storage form for datastructures, eliminating serialization and de-serialization operations.

    Finally, the presentation will describe how the hardware is managed, fromsequencing power to a rack full of high-performance computing hardware,through constructing custom Linux operating systems for each processor andmanaging all of them as parts of a single computing platform.

    How to turn legacy docs into user-story-based, modular content to better serveusers while reducing maintenance load and overall amount of docs.

    It has become cumbersome to wade through chapters upon chapters of docs,looking for the relevant bits, especially with the advent of embeddedapplications, container deployments, and other usage scenarios that targethighly specialized use cases. We need topic-based, action-oriented content toguide users through specific tasks. So, how do we turn the voluminous guidesof yesterday into lean, modularized narratives that are easy to maintain,scale well, and still allow for a ‘guide-like’ experience when it is required?In this presentation, Robert Kratky will describe the work docs writers at RedHat are doing to solve this problem: re-purposing the existing body ofdocumentation, so that its parts – adapted into modular units to allow forreuse – can be dynamically combined.

    Traditionally, Linux documentation has been perceived as lacking in userfriendliness and oftentimes in quality or scope. This presentation will helpattendees understand what problems Linux (and OSS) documentation faces, whatis being done to remedy the problems, and how can existing documentation beimproved or re-purposed to address future requirements and user expectations.The audience is anyone interested in documentation for Linux and open-sourceproducts, which includes technical writers, content strategists, supportengineers, developers, and members of management who want to understanddocumentation processes and new methods of supporting users throughdocumentation. Attendees can expect a presentation and discussion of ways tomodernize existing documentation and adapt it for new expectations with regardto content consumption.

    Tempesta FW is a high performance open source Linux application deliverycontroller (ADC). The project is built into the Linux TCP/IP stack to getmaximum performance for normal Web content delivery and efficient trafficfiltering for volumetric DDoS mitigation.

    I'll start by considering a simple example of how to build an ADC usingtraditional open source software. I'll describe drawbacks of the approach andwhy we started Tempesta FW's development. Next I'll go into the projectinternals and conclude the presentation with Tempesta FW performancebenchmarks and several examples.

    Application delivery controllers (ADCs) are typically hardware appliances thataccelerate Web content delivery, intelligently balance loads among upstreamservers, employ QoS and traffic shaping to efficiently and elegantly mitigateDDoS on all network layers, and provide Web application firewalling andapplication performance monitoring. However, it seems there are no open sourceprojects that are able to perform these tasks with comparable performance andaccuracy.

    In this presentation I'll describe Tempesta FW - a high performance, opensource Linux application delivery controller. The project is built into theLinux TCP/IP stack to get maximum performance for normal Web content deliveryand efficient traffic filtering for volumetric DDoS mitigation.

    I'll start by considering a simple example of an installation of Nginx,Fail2Ban, and IPtables. Alternative configurations containing other opensource projects will be covered as well. I'll describe why such configurationsusually do a poor job, and why we started Tempesta FW's development.

    Next I'll describe how Tempesta FW services HTTP requests, and how the HTTPlayer works with low-layer filter logic. There are several HTTP load-balancingstrategies, including flexible distribution of requests by almost any HTTPfield and predictive strategy by monitoring application performance. Severaltechnologies at the basis of Tempesta FW's performance will also be covered:

      * Linux TCP/IP stack optimizations for efficient HTTP proxying

      * stateless HTTP parsing and using AVX2 instruction set to efficiently process HTTP strings

      * lightweight in-memory database, TempestaDB, based on a cache-conscious lock-free data structure used for servicing a web cache

    I'll conclude with Tempesta FW performance benchmarks and show severalinstallation and configuration examples.

    Now, when many IT-related services are delegated to external parties,government, medical, financial, and other organizations need tight tracking ofwhat users and administrators do on their critical systems. Up to recordingeverything they see on the screen, the commands they execute, and files theyaccess.

    In this presentation Nikolai Kondrashov will review available solutions foruser session recording, open-source and otherwise, their benefits andshortcomings, and will present a new effort to create an integrated Open-Source solution.

    While there are many capable solutions for session recording, which cancentrally collect, search and playback sessions, there is no such open-sourcecode. The best we have is jump servers with script(1), or sudo I/O logging,all manually set up. This presentation will show an approach that would meetthe needs of the modern enterprise.

    The presentation will include a demo of a user session and accompanying databeing recorded, stored centrally, inspected and played back.

    The intended audience is developers of security, identity and policymanagement systems, as well as system administrators and security officersresponsible for maintaining critical systems and preventing insider attacks.

    This talk presents OW2's efforts, experience, vision and methodology to assessthe market readiness of open source softwa re. If ''open source software haswon'' it remains that many conventional managers are not comfortable with it :rating open source market readiness can be a powerful tool to help decisionmakers.

    OSS is everywhere in our enterprise information systems and in nearly all theelectronic systems we interact with daily, such as communication devices,cars, trains, healthcare systems, entertainment environments. With theincreasing success of OSS software and in parallel the advent of OSS qualityfailures such as Heartbleed, the quality and sustainability of OSS componentswe use and produce is becoming progressively as important as the quality ofthe air we breathe.

    OSS come in many different flavors. At OW2 identify three broad categories ofprojects. Those that are developed by a grassroot community, those that areessentialy developed and commercially supported by private companies and thosethat result from the collaborative efforts of ecosystems of commercialcompanies and research organisations. Our efforts aim at applying a commonvalue chain analysis across the different categories enable to be able tocompare them along a unified scale scale of market readiness levels. Thegrowing number of companies that specialize in assessing open source softwarereflect how crucial this topic is becoming for the whole economy.

    Initially derived from the seminal NASA's Technology Readiness Levels scaleand inspired by, among others, the SEI Capability Maturity Model, severalmodels and tools have been created in the last 20 years for describing andanalyzing the quality and maturity of open-source software. These early modelsaim at capturing the projects' general software engineering quality drivers,their open-source related aspects such as their IP and community management.The most well-known initiatives include the Qualipso Open Maturity Model, theQualification and Selection of Open Source software methodology, the SoftwareSustainability Maturity Model (OSS Watch), the NASA Reuse Readiness Levels andthe PolarSys Maturity Assessment model. More recently, the Linux Foundationhas launched the "Badge Program" project for drafting a new quality model foropen-source software.

    The existing models raise several questions: \- first of all, theses models donot always follow the same pace as the IT world: several models were draftedin a pre-cloud, pre-devops, pre-heartbleed area and do not cover importantaspects of modern OSS such as the ability to deploy easily a project into oneor several cloud environments. \- second, the models generally do not providea reference implementation for feeding the data with open-source software andfor providing both high-level and detailed quality analysis. \- third, whileit's easy to get a general consensus on software quality, divergences canappear when going into the details and attributing weights to the criteria,hence a need for a flexible model, \- fourth, these models concentrate on thetechnical assessment of software and projects and their interest from theperspective of the contributor

    This lightning talk will introduce: \- our analysis the value chain of opensource software: what makes software valuable from the stand point of the end-user and what are the stakeholders in the value chain; \- the OW2 Open-sourceSofware Capability Assessment Radar (OSCAR) platform, an open-source umbrellaproject implementing the OSCAR model by combining several open-source qualitytools such as SonarQube, Fossology, ScanCode, Spago4Q, and outcomes from theRISCOSS European collaborative project. \- the first version of OW2 OSS MarketReadiness Level (MRL) scale derived from data ana analysis provided by OSCAR,a work in progress that we are happy to share with and submit to the audience..

From a computer science point ofview, Alyvix is an open-source Python-based software, which can be deployed onWindows 64-bit machines as a part of an open-stack of libraries. Alyvix mainlyrelies on the following open-source software projects: RobotFramework fordesktop automation, OpenCV and Pillow for image processing, TesseractOCR fortext recognition and PyQt for GUI programming. Francesco Melchiori, as Alyvixproduct manager, will explain how Alyvix works leveraging on theaforementioned packages, what software design choices have been taken.Finally, he will show how this computer vision solution solves the need of aneffective visual synthetic monitoring of proprietary network applications.This aims to suggest other use cases with the Alyvix API.

    The open-source software Alyvix is a synthetic monitoring system, based oncomputer vision. It automates any application, interacting with GUIs exactlyas a human would do. In this way, Alyvix can check the availability and canmeasure the responsiveness of applications. Network applications suffer oflatencies, or even downtimes, because of many factors having to deal with thecomplexity of data communications, for example client software, protocols,telecommunication channels, backend hardware resources, etc. Monitoringapplication performances from the end user perspective is the first step forkeeping high the quality of the provided services. Alyvix provides GUI toolsto reproduce user interaction flows on any application, interacting throughmouse clicking, text typing or shortcut sending. Alyvix is not hardwired toapplication APIs but acts like a human user sitting in front of the monitor.Therefore, it is able to automate every on-premise or cloud application afterhaving built so-called test cases. Alyvix checks the availability of networkapplications and measures their responsiveness. Hence, it outputs how longtransactions take to be accomplished and reports the corresponding performancedata in HTML pages. In case of test failures, these reports will show ananimation of the broken transaction visually describing what has gone wrong.Through the integration with any monitoring system, for example Nagios orIcinga, performance time series charts can be created to recognize latencyspikes and service downtimes. Alyvix certifies the ongoing quality of serviceand highlights when and in which location it is higher or lower than expected.Thanks to these insights, IT operations teams can modulate infrastructureresources and IT clients can check their SLA with providers. From a computerscience point of view, Alyvix is an open-source Python-based software, whichcan be deployed on Windows 64-bit machines as a part of an open-stack oflibraries.

That's why we are convinced it is important to providefeedback mechanisms so that users can easily report bugs or feature requests.In many of our development projects we tried out various means to do justthat: users were guided to issue trackers like the ones provided by GitHub orJIRA, forums, emails or simple app store comments. The solutions were eithernot easy enough for users or simply did not scale well for developers.Commercial solutions didn't exactly fit our expectations or budget. Then wecame up with Requirements Bazaar! :) Requirements Bazaar is an Open Sourcesocial continuous innovation platform to bring together users, developers andoperators. It is freely available under https://requirements-bazaar.org and iscurrently hosting multiple interesting projects. Besides managing theinnovation of our research projects, we see users adopting it for variousexciting societal purposes like the digitalization processes of Afghanistan orcreating the new IEEE standard for Augmented Reality learning.

    This is how our Web app works: End users can enter their requirements byproviding short descriptions including use cases, screenshots and otherimages. The requirements can then be voted and shared. Then, developers maytake up ideas and transfer the discussed requirements to an issue tracker likeGitHub Issues.

    At FOSDEM 2017 we would like to encourage Open Source developers and designersin rethinking the way requirements are currently gathered from the crowd. Howdo we want to collect new software ideas or simply feature requests from ourusers? Is it effective to provide feedback forms in our apps’ “About” menu? Doour users think in terms of issues like we developers do? How can gamificationbe used to reward actual end-users of software? We hope Requirements Bazaarcan answer these questions and fill the gap!

    We are also happy to talk about our experiences developing a performantresponsive single-page Web application with Web Components using Polymer.

    The Unix [dgsh](http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/dgsh/) shell provides an expressiveway to construct sophisticated and efficient data processing pipelines usingstandard Unix tools, as well as third-party and custom-built components. Dgshallows the specification of pipelines of non-uniform non-linear operations.For example _tee_ can feed three processes whose output can then be collectedby _paste_. The pipelines form a directed acyclic process graph, which istypically executed by multiple processor cores, thus increasing the task'sprocessing throughput. We will see how to use _dgsh_ in practice through anumber of general data processing and domain-specific examples, and how toadapt tools for use with _dgsh_.

    # The Armadito antivirus project

    We will present Armadito, an open source and multi-platform antivirus. Itsoriginal modular architecture allows third-party developers to add their ownmalware detection modules, written in C and in the future in Python or Go.Current modules are signature-based (ClamAV), rules-based (YARA) orheuristics. It provides also real-time detection on GNU/Linux and MS-Windows.

    Armadito provides graphical user interfaces to notify of malware detection,launch scan, view statistics and journal. A central administration console,integrated as a GLPi plug-in, allows a system administrator to manage all theinstalled antivirus, view alerts, launch remote scans, deploy configuration orbases.

    Project has several opened issues that are not addressed yet: high memoryfootprint, sandboxing for scan modules, automatic generation of signaturebases from automatic malware collecting. Contributions from the free softwarecommunity would be highly appreciated.

    Armadito project is on github: (https://github.com/armadito)

    # The Armadito antivirus project

    ## What is it?

    Armadito is an open source antivirus, that runs on GNU/Linux and MS-Windows.Its modular architecture allows easy integration of new detection algorithms.

    Armadito provides standard antivirus features: on-demand scan, quarantine,alerts, journal and real-time (or "on-access") protection. This protection isimplemented on GNU/Linux using fanotify and on MS-Windows with its own driver.

    ## Modular architecture

    Armadito scans files using scan _modules_ , which are plugins written in C andusing a common API (load, configure, scan, unload).

    Current modules are:

      * ClamAV using libclamav  * YARA  * heuristic for PE and ELF binaries  * heuristic for PDF documents

    A future extension is to allow writing modules in Python and Go languages.

    ## User interfaces

    Armadito provides 2 user interfaces:

      * a lightweight graphical user interface, showing only notifications plus "systray" icon, developed using native toolkits  * a full interface, developed using web technologies (AngularJS), that runs in a browser and uses the antivirus REST API

    ## Antivirus administration

    The installed antivirus can be managed from a central console, that allowsthrough a web interface to view alerts, launch remote scans, deploy new basesor configuration. This console is integrated as a GLPi plugin.

    ## Next steps

    Future developments of the project are:

      * update MS-Windows code and release a MS-Windows version with installers  * make extensive testing  * improve documentation  * re-implement the heuristic module for PE/ELF binaries analysis  * provide an API to allow scan modules to be implemented in Python and GO  * improve code quality using sonarqube  * contribute to IRMA with Armadito plugin  * make Armadito antivirus be available inside virustotal.com and AVCaesar

    ## Issues

    The project has several opened issues which are not obvious to address:

      * memory footprint is too high, approximately 450M when using the ClamAV module, when compared to standard antivirus which have a momory footprint in the order of 100M  * scan modules should run inside a sandbox because they parse complex formats and unpackers, and a bug in the parser or a deliberately malformed file can crash the module and therefore compromise the entire antivirus  * providing up-to-date and good "signature" bases is yet to be done; it requires a strong architecture for malware collecting and automatic signature (likely YARA rules) generation

    The current team is small and contributions from the free software communitywould be highly appreciated.

    With DOM, software-defined architecture, advanced build tools, StackOverflowand ultra-high-level languages, main languages are still taught (and learned)via I/O operations, simple data structures, loops and switches, and littlespace to development and deployment environment advances and even algorithmicchanges, like asynchronous running, that completely upend the way programminglanguage, and programming, concepts should be assimilated. In thispresentation I'd like to advocate for a multi-lingual, multi-paradigm, multi-tool approach to learning programming languages and how this could eventuallybe carried out.

    The new century has seen an explosion of new ways of learning: through MOOCs,Webinars, bootcamps and incorporation of new technologies to learning. Still,syllabus of programming languages pretty much stays the same. There isenphasis in learning a single language (front end, back end, DSL) and aprogress that goes from very simple input/output operations through somesimple data structures to loops and other programming structures. This worksusually well and the proof is all around us; besides, the ten firstprogramming languages are the hardest, it is downhill from there. However, itcould be much easier if we acknowledged the existence of this multi-environment (console, UI, web, embedded), multi-language (many languages in asingle application, from data description to UI language), multi-tool (fromsimple compilation tools to deployment and monitoring tools) and organized ourlearning experience around it. And first we should use whatever we have onhand, like command-line interfaces (some of them with powerful languages) oreven the browser itself, which always include a programmer mode. Also usevisual languages like Scratch to teach more complicated concepts, as long asthey are put into use with languages that can run the whole nine yards. Inthis lightning talk I will try to outline what would be the first basic stepsin a course following these principles, and why I think this would lead tofaster formation of programmers and the creation of a more adaptive mindsetwhen tackling new careers or project in programming.

    A rough overview on the pretty Easy privacy (p≡p) project:

    p≡p stands for pretty Easy privacy. The idea is to ease the use of well-knownand established end-to-end cryptographic tools for already existing and widelyused written digital communication channels, starting with email and radicallyeasing adoption of OpenPGP-compliant encryption for it. Later on, XMPP-basedcommunication channels (using e.g. OTR) and others will be added, with theultimate goal to route all messages through GNUnet, a secure peer-to-peerframework, which doest not just protect message contents, but also metadata.

    Basically, p≡p's proposed and (to some degree) already implemented protocolsautomate the steps taught to users at CryptoPartys, from which the projectemerged.

    p≡p supports multiple platforms (e.g., Android, *BSDs, GNU/Linuxdistributions, iOS, MacOS X and Windows), multiple programming languages andenvironments (e.g., C#/COM, C++/Qt, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C/Swift andPython) and will provide easy access to multiple crypto technologies throughan abstract API which doesn't require application developers to have in-depthcryptographic knowledge, i.e. the p≡p engine takes care of the details. Thefocus for now is to have OpenPGP-compatible communications for emailwidespread, using already existing crypto tools like GnuPG and a NetPGP fork(needed for iOS).

    p≡p's core parts (the p≡p engine and the adapters / bindings for differentprogramming languages) are owned by the Swiss-based, tax-free p≡p foundationand held under the GNU GPL v3 license alongside with the p≡p trademarks. Thefoundation is run by privacy activists from Germany and Switzerland. Anyproject willing to implement p≡p will be supported, especially in the FreeSoftware world. For trust and security reasons, the p≡p foundation requiresprojects to let their p≡p implementations code audited by a trustworthyindependent firm upon every release, if they want to use the p≡p trademarks,so as to make sure there are no backdoors in officially endorsed p≡p end-usersoftware. The p≡p foundation, for cases where the money for such undertakingsis not available, is willing to either finance the code audits itself or toorganize such funding at least.

    p≡p foundation has close cooperations with the Enigmail (Enigmail 2.0 will beEnigmail/p≡p), the GNUnet project and soon ISOC Switzerland (ISOC-CH).

    But there's also extensive exchange with other groups like the CCC(particularly in Switzerland), the FSFE, the Mozilla Foundation (MozillaThunderbird in particular), The Reva & David Logan Foundation and the GnuPGproject.

    The Lightning Talk will be quite short: 10mins. 5mins will be reserved for(hopefully) lots of questions. :) (For further and more detailled questions,just visit us at the GNU Taler / p≡p foundation stand in building K, level 1,group A.)

    The speaker, Hernâni Marques, is council member of the p≡p foundation.

    (Note that this talk was originally going to be presented by Volker Birk, p≡pfoundation's council president, who now cannot be present.)

    This talk focusses on how QtPass went from a 2 evening necessity project toget management in on using a group password manager, to a full fledged projectwith over 40 contributors that is available on all linux distributions andOSs.

    Working at a full service internet bureau I was shocked to see their way ofstoring credentials. The most shocking thing was that this seemed to bedefacto industry standard behaviour.

    A solution for the developers was soon found in pass, the standard UNIXpassword manager.

    Unfortunately management in unable (or rather unwilling) to use CLI tools. Soin two evenings I wrote a quick graphical read-only password viewer that usedpass to allow management to view passwords. As an added bonus, all internalmails between developers and management were now instantly encrypted aswel.

    I put it on github, under a group label, did a little hackathon to have peoplehelp me translate it to some languages and thought that was it.

    But this was only the start of my adventures into opensource projectmanagement.

    Clouds are spreading and software is eating the world. But software depends onhardware. If that hardware is not trustworthy, open and secure, the software'strustworthiness, openness and security is for naught. The Free Softwarecommunity has been forced to live with this conundrum for lack of goodalternatives. Too pervasive and omnipresent was the Intel defined x86architecture, throttling innovation, while sequestering security and controlfrom its users.

    Most of the discussion in our community centred around damage control andpreventing being locked out from the platform for good. We focused our effortson protecting our ability to use our own software. Positively shaping thefuture, driving the direction, and solving the problem of trustworthy hardwarefor good and at scale seemed impossible.

    But, the thing is, without (almost) anybody noticing, all of the above haschanged.

    Georg Greve, CEO of [Kolab Systems](https://kolabsystems.com "Kolab SystemsHome Page"), will talk about the journey [Kolab](https://www.kolab.org "KolabHome Page") took to discover OpenPOWER, what we found in the [OpenPOWERFoundation](https://openpowerfoundation.org "OpenPOWER Foundation"), and whatit all means for Free Software.

    In this session you will learn how far we have come in our quest to run a datacentre for High Performance Computing on a complete open hardware and softwareplatform, a platform that, at the same time, far outperforms Intel. We willalso cover the TALOS secure work station and what it brings to our community.

    OpenScore is a new initiative to liberate public domain music using MuseScore,the leading open-source music notation program. The aim is to uniteMuseScore’s millions of users in an effort to digitise and liberate the worksof Mozart, Beethoven and other famous classical composers. OpenScore extendsthe principles of open source to apply not only to software, but also to thecontent produced by the software, thereby opening up a new avenue of fundingfor open source software development.

    The goal of OpenScore is to improve access to public domain music. The projectis a collaboration between MuseScore, the leading open-source music notationprogram, and IMSLP, the largest online archive of public domain music.

    The IMSLP archive contains scanned copies of scores by Mozart, Beethoven andother classical composers in “binary” PDF format, which allows musicians toread them, but not edit or listen to them. OpenScore will unlock the truepotential of the scores by making the actual “source code” to the musicavailable in MuseScore’s text-based format, which allows listening, editing,and easy conversion to other formats like MusicXML, MIDI and PDF, as well asall audio, video and image formats. Text-based scores offer improvedaccessibility over PDFs, and are easily parseable by software tools to allowsearching, indexing, data mining, and analysis for research purposes.

    To make this happen, OpenScore will adopt the open source model and draw uponthe strength of MuseScore’s massive online community. The digital scores willbe published under a Creative Commons license to allow anyone to adapt, shareand improve upon the transcriptions.

    Even though TPMs are cryptographic processors, it is surprisingly hard to usethem for common cryptographic operations like signatures and decryption.

    Moreover, as opposed to its predecessor TPM1.2, TPM2.0 gets a very littlesupport in Linux and the TGC Software Stack has no support for the most commonencoding formats (e.g. PEM and DER).

    Event logging is important not only for IT security and operations, but alsofor business decisions. The syslog-ng application is an enhanced loggingdaemon, with a focus on central log collection. It collects logs from manydifferent sources, processes and filters them and finally it stores them orroutes them for further analysis. From this session you will learn (usingexamples from syslog-ng) why and how to parse important information fromincoming messages, and how to route logs, feeding downstream systems usingarbitrary formats. We will also discuss how the client – relay – serverarchitecture can solve scalability problems. Also, I will present some of therecently introduced “Big Data” destinations of syslog-ng, which can help toscale your infrastructure even further.

    ## Outline:

      * what is syslog-ng  * log collection  * introduction to log processing  * filtering  * Big Data destinations  * log formats - the importance of name-value pairs  * message parsing (both unstructured and some structured message formats)  * formatting (templates, anonymization)  * log routing (optimizing analytics infrastructure)  * client (collection) - relay (processing) - server (storing, routing)  * summary

    We share our experiences with a new framework in the Linux kernel forprogramming reconfigurable devices, namely MPSoC-FPGAs. Our example use caseintegrates reconfigurable hardware accelerators into the Crypto API. We applya new, declarative and device-tree-driven reconfiguration framework within theLinux kernel as proposed and implemented by Alan Tull. The implemented conceptmaps reconfigurable regions within the FPGA to device tree nodes. Theinsertion of a device tree overlay triggers the reconfiguration of thecorresponding reconfigurable region. The reconfiguration process consists ofthe scheduling, descheduling and execution phase. Based on our usecase,benchmark results for the scheduling phases are shared. We present thebottlenecks revealed by our benchmark and show currently missing components ofthis approach. We conclude that the current implementation is already in ausable state for developing and deploying MPSoC-FPGA based heterogeneoussystems.

    The Raspberry PI 3 board is very popular, but mainly known as a Linuxplatform. But it could also be used to do bare metal development: writing low-level code without any OS. There are almost no tutorials on the internetaddressing the main new feature of the RPI-3 board: 4x 64 bit cores (previousgenerations were 32 bit). Let's fill the gap by this lightening talk: a veryshort presentation of the board, how to write and build a first example and ademo of a more advanced multi-core application.

    What if you could send money to anyone, instantly, in any currency andpractically for free? What if users could support your project with tinyamounts of money each time they use it? What if we could use anything of valueas "currency" and have it automatically exchanged when we want to make apayment?

    Interledger is the inter-networking protocol for money. It enables securetransfers across different currencies and payment networks. By connecting alldifferent types of payment networks or ledgers together, Interledger can helpcreate an "Internet of Value".

    The Catholique University of Louvain (Université catholique de Louvain - UCL)decided to rewrite their core business applications from Java/EE toPython/Django and make them freely available as open source software. Thispresentation intends to share with the community the experience on buildingOSIS, the open source transition, the cultural and technical shift, theengagement of students, teachers and employees on the improvement of their ownuser experience, the costs implied and the productivity gains.

    OSIS (Open Student Information System) is an application designed to managethe core business of higher education institutions. It is free and open sourceunder the terms of GPL v3 public license, aligned with the strong spirit ofknowledge sharing and collaboration with the community. The project issponsored by [Université catholique deLouvain](http://uclouvain.be/index.html) (UCL) in the context of its long termgoal of modernising its information systems towards the next generation ofstudents, devices, practices and technologies.

    We aim that UCL and many other higher education institutions adopt OSIS to beable to maintain, control and monitor the entire student’s career. Thisextends from the admission to the diploma and all information orbiting thisfundamental process, such as planning the academic year, managing partnershipswith other institutions for exchange and mobility programs, assigning teachersto courses and courses to students, etc. At the current stage, OSIS isdesigned to fulfil UCL’s needs, but it can be properly adapted to fulfil moreneeds coming from other institutions interested in joining the project, whichis the case of Université Saint-Louis, Bruxelles.

    For us, offering a reusable system is not the only advantage of being opensource. It also means:

      * fully transparent operations for the entire academic community;  * inspiration for entrepreneurs to build integrated services to improve students academic experience;  * empower departments, endowed with the necessary expertise, to fulfill their particular needs by extending OSIS;  * build up students' experience on real world projects to boost their chances when applying for a job or founding a company; and  * reduced maintenance cost for the University thanks to the range of reliable open source products required by the application.

    But the path to open source was not simple. It required lots of discussions tofinally find a realistic long term formula to meet the institution's majorgoals. Now that it is our reality, this history cannot be kept aside, butshared with FOSDEM's community. We are going to answer the following questionsduring the presentation:

      * Why we are sharing our core business applications before any other higher education institution.  * How the academic community persuaded us to use Python/Django/PostgreSQL instead of JavaEE.  * How we are adapting to this new reality that requires much more discipline and high quality craftsmanship work.  * Why there is no doubt we will succeed in this entrepreneurship.  * Why we need your help to better manage and write this open source software.

    GridSound uses many new HTML5 technologies, the main one is the Web Audio APIwhich provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on theWeb. We chose to extract all the reusable Web Audio code into a standalonelibrary: webaudio-library. The user's intial audio sample files have to bedropped into the app then into the samplegrid. For these actions we use theDrag and drop API, and for opening and read the files we use the File API.User Interface : We write our design with a modern CSS3 without any browserprefixes (eg : -webkit, -moz) and by using properties like transition anddisplay: flex, the CSS is organised into different files using Sass (SCSS).The HTML part is separated into different templates, for that we useHandlebars. We use <canvas> to draw a live audio analyser of the masteroutput, and all the audio waveform are drawn with SVG.

    What does it take to implement continuous integration-style automated testinginto a mailing list-driven software project? Not a lot, actually. In thistalk, we demonstrate how a simple but easily scaled testing system can beimplemented for a such a project through the combination of Patchwork, theweb-based patch tracking system, and open source CI tools such as Jenkins.

    At FOSDEM 2016, developers working on Patchwork, the web-based patch trackingsystem, demonstrated some of the ongoing work in Patchwork. This work rangedfrom UI improvements to new features and APIs but, collectively, it had thegoal of enabling automated testing functionality for software projectsdeveloped via mailing lists. The Patchwork developers have been busy sincethen and the application, in widespread use since 2008, recently hit the 2.0milestone, marking this functionality as complete.

    Projects such as the Dataplane Development Kit (DPDK) have quickly adopted thefeatures that 2.0 brings, using them to enable real time, automated testing ofpatches sent to the mailing list. This automated testing provides a mechanismfor developers to not only sidestep the more perfunctory of tasks, such ascoding standard checks, but also to test changes in environments that they maynot have at their disposal, such as differing hardware or OS configurations.As seen in projects pairing open source code collaboration tools like Gerritor Rietveld with CI systems such as Jenkins or BuildBot, this continuoustesting can provide huge improvements in developer velocity.

    In this talk, we demonstrate how to build a basic "checkstyle" testing systemthrough a combination of Patchwork and an off-the-shelf, open source CIsystem. This system will retrieve patches and dependencies, apply and testthem, and report the results back to both Patchwork and a separate mailinglist. This configuration demonstrates the best of Patchwork's new features,and can be easily extended to cover far more complex testing scenarios.

We will focus on the challengesfaced integrating those protocols into Outlook. A case study of a largedeployment in an university infrastructure will show the benefits of such asolution.

    Microsoft Exchange/Outlook together with the Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)protocol for mobile clients is still the most widely used groupware solutionin enterprise environments. But what open source alternatives exist asExchange replacements out there? Actually, there are many productsimplementing the open CalDAV and CardDAV protocols like SOGo, Horde Groupware,Zarafa or Owncloud/Nextcloud. Client integration is possible with mobile iOSand Android clients and desktop clients like Thunderbird/Lightning, butOutlook users were kept in the dark or needed proprietary 3rd partyconnectors. In 2015 even Zarafa, which had a strong focus on seamless Outlookintegration, announced the discontinuation of their connector. A promisingalternative, SOGo together with OpenChange as a native Open Source MAPIimplementation, is not yet production ready in large scale enterprisescenarios and development stalled lately. Luckily, there is another solutionon the horizon. This talk introduces the only open source Outlook addin,Outlook CalDav Synchronizer, to synchronize calendars, tasks and contacts withCalDAV and CardDAV servers, Google or iCloud services. We will focus on thechallenges faced integrating those protocols into Outlook. Together with otheropen source solutions like SOGo or Nextcloud and DAVDroid for Android, a fullopen source exchange server replacement for desktop and mobile clients isfinally possible and enterprise ready.

    This talk will introduce Kopano, a fork of Zarafa which aims to provide afully AGPLv3-licensed collaboration platform. The Kopano backend offers ICAL,POP3 / IMAP connectivity. Our Kopano-webapp web-based front-end offersfunctionality similar to Outlook. It also comes with optional WebRTC and Filessharing integration. Mobile device and outlook connectivity are provided bythe Z-Push project which implements the ActiveSync protocol.

    Kopano is a fork of Zarafa and a full AGPLv3 collaboration platform.

    Kopano implements the MAPI specification and uses a MySQL database forstorage, attachments can be stored on disk or in S3 to reduce the size of theMySQL database. Administrators are free to choose any MTA to be used incombination with Kopano.

    The core of Kopano is one (or multiple) kopano-server('s) which providestorage and authentication via various supported user backends: LDAP / AD / DBand PAM. All other functionality is implemented in MAPI clients, which areclients of the server and can be written in PHP or Python through use of ourown bindings. These clients communicate MAPI over SOAP, which means that theserver can not act as a drop-in replacement for Microsoft Exchange since thekopano-server does not implement the wire-protocol.

    The 'MAPI clients' provide the rest of the collaboration functionality:

      * kopano-gateway IMAP, POP3 server (conversion of IMAP <=> MAPI, POP3 <=> MAPI)  * kopano-ical ICAL server (conversion of ICAL <=> MAPI)  * kopano-webapp An web-based front-end which offers functionality similar to Outlook  * z-push PHP ActiveSync implementation, adds connectivity with Mobile devices (IMAP, Maildir, MAPI => ActiveSync)  * kopano-dagent Interface between MTA / MAPI. Converts EML's to MAPI Messages. Python plugins for administrators  * kopano-spooler Interface between MTA / MAPI. Converts MAPI Messages to EML's. Python plugins for administrators

    ## Upstream support

    The project is working with Debian maintainers to get Kopano packaged inDebian stretch.

    https://wiki.debian.org/Groupware/Kopano

    There is an Open SuSe Build service repository.

    https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/server:mail:kopano

    ## Python-kopano

    Since the rewrite of search from C++ to Python, there has been a lot ofdevelopment towards a high level Python API for Kopano. Which allows aprogrammer to interact with Kopano as a client without MAPI knowledge. Abackup tool has later been build on this high level API and we hope to removemore low-level C++ with Python and maybe eventually rewrite the whole serverin Python and interact with components using a JSON protocol.

    The Smart Grid is coming, at webscale, enabled by Internet of Things,resulting in Big Data. A clear statement, right? Not at all! Let me show youwhat is going on behind these buzzwords:

      1. First I'll take you briefly through the analog origins of utility energy data to help you understand why this seems counter-intuitive by modern standards.  2. Second I'll go over the driving force for opening up the energy data: why sustainable energy demands it, and how businesses and consumers can benefit.  3. Then having created a common understanding of the word of energy data, I'll go over developments in mainly the field of Internet of Things to highlight the potential, but also where it fall short to support renewable energy. I will specifically address practical technologies and frameworks, and some examples of energy data usage.

    This lightning talk will provide you with the necessary context and links tostart working with energy data in your own projects. As a bonus it will alsomake you aware of differences inside Europe, as this might be a hindrance inyour project.

    Simulation Open Framework Architecture (SOFA) is an open source multiplatformframework primarily targeted at real-time physical simulation, with anemphasis on medical simulation.

    It is mostly intended for the research community to help develop newalgorithms, but can also be used as an efficient prototyping tool or as aphysics engine.

    Started in 2004, SOFA is currently developed by 4 research teams from Inria(french research institute): Mimesis, Imagine, Defrost and Asclepios.

    Based on a C++ advanced software architecture, SOFA allows to:  \- Create **complex and evolving simulations** by combining new algorithmswith existing algorithms  \- Modify most parameters of the simulation (deformable behavior, surfacerepresentation, solver, constraints, collision algorithm, ...) by simplyediting an XML file  \- Build complex models from simpler ones using a scene graph description  \- Efficiently simulate the dynamics of interacting objects using **abstractequation solvers**  \- Reuse and easily compare a variety of available methods  \- Transparently **parallelize** complex computations using semantics based ondata dependencies  \- Use new generations of GPUs through the CUDA API to greatly improvecomputation times

    Today, SOFA gathers more than 10 years of research in physics simulation. Manypublications were accepted, several simulators were developed and fivestartups were created.  The research topics are diverse:  \- **Solid mechanics** with the simulation of the brain, the eye, the heart,the liver, the bones  \- **Thermodynamics** with thermo-ablation of tumors  \- Many other topics as **image processing** , **Fluid dynamics** ,**animation** or **biological applications**

    Many years ago I built a FOSS Android application for our local bike sharingsystem. After realizing global bike sharing information was not publiclyavailable we ended up going after the task of solving the problem for once andfor all: a free and open API for others to create applications, visualizationsand research on bike sharing data. Fast forward today and thanks to thecommunity, the CityBikes project supports more than 400 cities all around theworld and our API powers most bike sharing transportation apps on allplatforms.

    The CityBikes project is a good example of the benefits on the so-called "opendata". When data is made available, the community is eager to contribute toand improve public services. We are usually regarded as an "open dataproject", even though less than 10% of our data feeds come from properlylicensed, documented and machine readable feeds. Our project showcases theneed of a better policy than the PSI Directive [2] regarding re-use of publicsector information, and some common misconceptions between representation anddata.

    The main problem with the PSI Directive is that it does not take into accountPublic-Private partnerships (PPP). If data ownership or re-use is left out ofthe deal, the company kidnaps the data and leaves both the city council andits citizens at the mercy of the company providing the service. That is, onlythe company (or any other company in agreement with the "umbrella company") isto provide applications to use their systems. We as citizens should demandthat any project that comes as a result of a public-private partnership shouldput the data right where it belongs: the public.

    When I started this project on the year 2010 little did I know I would end upbattling city councils and companies to release their data as public feeds,nor I could imagine pybikes [3] was going to help create apps for allplatforms [4] without having to code a single line.

    SPARK is a programming language and a set of tools for building highlyreliable software. The SPARK language is a subset of Ada and can be compiledwith the GNAT toolchains to a wide range of platforms, including the popularARM Cortex M3, M4 and M7. The SPARK language also provides specificationfeatures, so that the intended behavior of the program can be embedded in theprogram itself. The SPARK formal verification tool can check that a programdoes not contain any run-time error, such as buffer or integer overflows, andthat the code complies with its specification. We will demonstrate thesecapabilities on a game of Tetris, whose core game logic has been proved, andwhich has been ported to several embedded platforms: SAM4S Xplained ProEvaluation Kit, Pebble Time watch, Unity game engine, Arduboy game platform.We will show in particular that you don’t need any specific mathematicalbackground to achieve such results!

    If you run an open source project, and you'd like to get contributions fromemployees at medium-to-large companies, the simplest way to provide a smoothcontribution process is to _not_ use a Contributor License Agreement. If yourproject requires one, though, there are steps you can take to ease the burdenthis causes on contributions from company employees, and this talk will covera number of issues encountered during 4+ years of managing contributions froma 20K+ employee global company.

    While there is a growing movement in the open source community away fromContributor License Agreements, many important projects still require them.Some of these projects are focused on 'enterprise' usage, so as a resultemployees of major companies want to contribute. However, the mechanisms usedto execute these CLAs vary widely (it seems that every project builds its ownCLA system), and none of them take into account the various legal andlogistical requirements of a major corporation who wants to contribute. Thistalk will present a series of problems encountered as a contributing company,and propose ways that CLA-requiring projects can resolve them.

    These problems include (but are no means limited to): requiring the agreementto be executed on a social media platform; providing no ability for theauthorized signer and the manager of the authorized employee list to bedifferent people; requiring FAXed copies of agreements; failing to provide theability to authorize employees to contribute to specific codebases within alarge project; and more.

    During the last few years there has been significant debate over approaches toGPL enforcement in technical and legal communities. This talk presents a newand unique vendor perspective on free software license enforcement thatemphasizes the goal of fostering greater collaboration and participation incommunity development and highlights the importance of transparency regardingfunding relationships and conflicts of interest arising out of enforcementactivities.

    During the last few years there has been significant debate over approaches toGPL enforcement in developer and legal communities. This talk presents aunique vendor perspective on free software license enforcement that has beenshaped by deep organizational involvement in free software development,longstanding cultural ties to GPL-using communities, and a strong corporateemphasis on ethical conduct.

    Where compliance efforts adhere strictly to certain principles, they canprovide a legitimate mechanism for ensuring that everyone plays by the rulesestablished by the community through the license. But the ultimate objectiveof enforcement should be to foster greater collaboration and participation incommunity development.

    The Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement published in 2015 by theSoftware Freedom Conservancy and Free Software Foundation represent a goodfirst step in articulating an appropriately principled basis for copyleftenforcement. However, there are some gaps in the Principles that should beaddressed by communities supportive of license enforcement. In particular, forenforcement to have community legitimacy, there needs to be an expectation ofdisclosure of funding relationships and exposure and resolution of thepotential conflicts of interest that may arise in enforcement activity.

    Many projects start out with the intention of staying single license FOSSprojects. As your project grows, reality hits: some components or files mayneed to use different licenses than originally anticipated. There are manyreasons why this can happen: you may need to interface with projects ofanother license, you may want to import code from other projects or yourdevelopers may not understand the subtleties of the licenses in use. Besidesthe obvious challenges of managing mixed license FOSS projects, such aslicense compatibility and tracking what licenses you use, you are running therisk of exposing your project to unintended consequences.

    This talk will explore unintended consequences, risks and best practices usingsome examples from the recent history of the Xen Project. In particular wewill cover:

      1. Refactoring can lead to licensing changes: best practices and unintended consequences when importing code from elsewhere. Making code archeology easy from a licensing perspective and why it is important.  2. A worked example of a license change of a key component: process, pain points, their causes and how they could have been avoided  3. The perils of LGPL/GPL vX (or Later): the unintended consequences of not providing pre-defined copyright headers in your source base

    We will conclude with a summary of lessons and best practices.

    Open source license compliance has become more complex as time progresses.Using open source tools and open standards (SPDX), we should be able to makeit easy to comply with the terms of the licenses specified in the code, andnot require expensive proprietary technologies. This talk will outline somesteps that will help to make license compliance more transparent, and withautomation, make it easier to fulfill the obligations.

    Using an openly developed standard (SPDX), and open source tooling it is nowpossible to generate accurate summary information for a project with opensource tools, that can be shared with those that use the project. Softwaredevelopment today builds thousand of open source components that developershave shared, tools permit composition of new interfaces from code from manysources, conveying the licensing information hasn't always been a priority fordevelopers, and as a result there's a fair amount of ambiguity out there thatneeds sophisticated proprietary tooling to decipher the actual licenses ineffect. By leveraging automation to generate this information when a projectbuilds, it ensures that the intentions of the authors are accurate and caneasily be respected.

    This talk will overview the problem scope and then propose some open sourcetools that can help start the automation part using open standards to improvethe transparency of the information.

    Drones have become ubiquitous: from small toys to remote piloted aircrafts,they are not uncommon anymore. FOSS is fundamental for the drone (or UAV)environment: several drone platforms are based on it, like Dronecode andvarious autopilot systems. The talk will address the possible interactionswith FOSS drone components, and the pressing issues of security and privacy.

    Drones were, not many years ago, an exotic item, straight from SF movies. Invery few years, they have become ubiquitous, and FOSS has played a fundamentalrole in this very fast expansion. Several important drone platforms andsoftware rely on FOSS components, and one of the most prominent projects,Dronecode, is governed by the Linux Foundation. The expansion of drones hastriggered a regulatory frenzy, not only at the national level, but also at theEuropean one: EASA (the European Aviation Safety Authority) has alreadyreleased the second draft of the ‘Prototype’ Commission Regulation on UnmannedAircraft Operations, which may be approved during 2017, while the EU GeneralData Protection Regulation 2016/679 has several articles which have a directinfluence on the developing of drones. Principles like data protection bydesign and data protection by default cannot be ignored for developersinvolved in FOSS drone platforms. The talk will examine the current (andfuture) European Legal framework, in order to assess the interactions betweenEU safety security and privacy regulations, and the “FOSS powered” developmentof drones.

    Tom Callaway, the Fedora Legal chair, will talk about the past, present, andfuture of licensing and legal issues in the Fedora community. Tom is not alawyer, nor does he play one on TV, but he does consult with lawyers, andoccasionally, go drinking with them. Bring your questions, and he'll do hisbest to answer them. I am not a lawyer, so nothing in my presentation shouldbe (or could be) construed as legal advice.

    Fedora, as the evolution of Red Hat Linux, is one of the oldest and most wellknown Linux distributions in existence today. For more than 10 years, I havebeen the Fedora Legal representative who investigates licenses, negotiateswith lawyers, advises our community, and does everything in my power to nothave to tell people "no" without a very good reasoning.

    In my presentation, I'll discuss the past, present, and future of licensingand legal issues in the Fedora community (and beyond). I'm also happy to takequestions from the FOSDEM audience as to why Fedora does what it does (ordoesn't do what it doesn't do).

    I am not a lawyer, so nothing in my presentation should be (or could be)construed as legal advice. I am however, a well informed hacker, and theeditor/maintainer of possibly the largest list of FOSS licenses in existence.

    When Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are becoming more broadly deployed(sometimes as part of proprietary systems) amongst organisations who havelimited pre-understanding of the philosophy underlying FOSS there are a numberof challenges which need to be successfully addressed. Such challenges includelicensing obligations for FOSS and a number of associated legal issues, suchas patents, trademarks, procurement law, and various conditions (e.g. FRAND-terms) for use of standards. Many companies and public sector organisationsstruggle with these challenges and there are sometimes tensions and legaldisputes between different interests, which may involve organisations andindividuals contributing to specific open source projects.

    This panel seeks to address the following overarching question: Which are thecontemporary legal and policy challenges needed to be better understoodthrough systematic research studies, and what relevant studies should bedesigned and conducted in order to produce relevant research results as wellas practical outcomes in order to shed light on these challenges?

    Since June 2014 we face an EU directive that threatens all wireless devices.The Radio Equipment Directive requires all devices that are able to send andreceive radio signals to be locked down. This goes much further than the FCClockdown in the US since it doesn't only affect routers but also mobilephones, GPS receivers, and amateur radio operators.

    From June 2017 hardware manufacturers will be forced to install technicalmeasurements to protect the devices from being flashed with "non-compliant"software: firmware that hasn't been checked by the manufacturer to comply withapplicable radio regulations (e.g. signal strenght, frequences). Many Europeanstates already have implemented the directive in national law without manyways how to circumvent the major lockdown.

    However, we have identified possible ways how to excluded certain classes ofdevices from this directive. The speaker will evaluate the current situation,present additional findings and opinions of political and economic actors, andexchange ideas and knowledge with the audience.

    More and more devices connect to the Internet and each other using wirelessand mobile networks. These include countless devices such as routers, mobilephones, WiFi-cards and laptops. All of them, as well as all Internet-of-Thingsdevices, today and in the future, fall under the regulation of the RadioEquipment Directive 2014/53/EU (hereinafter ‘the Directive’), adopted in May2014 by the European Parliament and the European Council. The main purposes ofthe Directive are harmonisation of existing regulations, improving security ofradio spectra, and protection of health and safety.

    Many people agree to general purpose of the Directive. However, we express ourconcerns over the far-reaching consequences of Article 3(3)(i) of theDirective, which require device manufacturers to check each device software'scompliance in order to comply with the Directive.

    ## Threats of Radio Lockdown

    We believe such requirement has negative implications on users' rights andFree Software, fair competition, innovation, environment, and volunteering –mostly without comparable benefits for security.

    Article 3(3)(i) require device manufacturers to assess software for compliancewith existing national radio regulations, a requirement which will keep usersand companies from upgrading the software on devices they own, unless thatsoftware is assessed by the original manufacturer. This not only is a severeburden for device manufacturers themselves but also violating the customers'rights of free choice.

    The requirement enshrined in Article 3(3)(i) will impact the freedom toconduct business of many companies relying on the abillity to providealternative and Free Software firmware on devices. Alternative software is thefoundation of many companies' products, and we should prevent economicdisadvantages for these businesses.

    Burdensome requirements to check every possible software's compliance willalso have negative implications on innovation and charitable non-profitorganisations who rely on software other than the manufacturers'. Efforts ofvolunteer associations helping people in need to connect to the internet, maybe rendered void or severely handicapped.

    Furthermore, alternative software on radio devices also promotes a sustainableeconomy. There are many devices still in working order which do not receiveupdates from the original manufacturers anymore, hence alternative softwaredeveloped and improved by community efforts (such as Free Software) has a muchlonger support period which prevent users and customers having to dispose ofstill working equipment. In return, this also improves the security of userssince older hardware still receives security updates after a manufacturerstops supporting those.

    We are in favor of the Directive's aim to improve security of radio devicesbut not at the unbalanced expense of users' freedom and security in otherareas. Firstly, upgrading the software of a device mostly helps increasing thedevices' security. Secondly, we are convinced that such strict regulations arenot necessary for typical consumer products with limited radio output power.And thirdly, we believe that such technical restrictions will not hinderpeople willingly violating applicable radio regulations.

    ## Our Proposals

    Therefore, we ask EU institutions and the Member States to take these concernsinto consideration and ensure that the Directive does not place blanket,unnecessary and disproportionate restrictions on the rights of consumers andbusinesses when implementing the Directive into national legislations.

    What does it look like when we apply Open Source software licenses andpractices to hardware? How do authors intend for Open Source licenses andcopyleft principles to apply to hardware, across its many types of componentsand interconnects, and what legal frameworks can preserve that intent?Hardware raises new scenarios and questions; how might we extrapolate ourprinciples to them? We'll propose some use cases to explore intent and idealoutcomes, and invite discussion on how to get there.

    The first hardware-focused Open Source activities started around 20 years ago.But even as open hardware itself matures, the legal aspects remain relativelyunexplored, and many unanswered legal questions remain. We'll examine what"licensing" means in terms of hardware, and discuss the adequacy of currentlyavailable mechanisms to express the intent of the authors and creators of openhardware. From our experience in Open Source software, we naturally attempt tofind parallels in software licenses that can be applied to hardware; however,hardware designs introduce new aspects that have no equivalent in the softwareworld.

    In particular, we're especially interested in how the ideas and principles ofcopyleft translate. How do things like linking, derivative works, andcompilation operate in terms of hardware? What "exclusive rights" belong toauthors and makers in this domain, and can we offer a license to those rightsthe same way we can for software copyrights? What rights dobuilders/fabricators have? How does a license on a digital description affectthe manufacture, distribution, and copying of the corresponding physicalobjects it describes? How do the various types of components within an openhardware design interact, and how do the licenses of those components interactover the many ways of connecting those components together? And can we applyor adapt existing Open Source software licenses for hardware, withoutfragmenting the ecosystem between software and hardware, especially as thelines between the two become increasingly fluid?

    We'll explore each of these areas, using as a case study the creation,licensing, and distribution of a product incorporating both open software andmany types of open hardware. We'll offer our thoughts on some possibleproperties of an ideal open hardware licensing framework, seek consensus onhow our principles apply in various concrete scenarios, and invite discussionon how our legal structures can adapt to serve the needs of the developingOpen Source hardware world.

    This talk examines the way the free software community communicates with oneanother, and ways codes of conduct and community guidelines affect language.By analyzing mailing lists, looking at the frequency with which participantsuse slurs and expletives before and after the institution of codes of conduct,we can see how effective these policies are, and what sort of spaces they arecreating for community members and project contributors.

    This talk is the follow up to talks at Libre Planet (2016) and SeaGL (2016),taking a mostly (and then progressively less) humorous look on language usedon Twitter and mailing lists, and the positive and negative ways we use stronglanguage to talk about free software, and talk to each other about freesoftware. This talk will include a general look at the purpose of codes ofconduct and community guidelines, what sort of things make one policy "good"or "bad," and, when possible, the process by a given community agrees on theinstitution of one. It will then focus on statistical analysis of language useon a chosen number of mailing lists (including the Linux Kernel Mailing List),with outstanding examples.

    This talk will likely include some strong language.

    A thread on an Apache mailing list (Now safely in the past) provides a greatillustration of what not to do when your employer's interests seem to needengagement in an open source community. Instead of asking a suitably-trainedlawyer to directly engage, the company asked an engineer to engage when theywanted special terms for a contribution. They went on to propose custom terms,a custom CLA and even implied that they wanted private bilateral negotiations.This session runs through the thread and draws seven lessons for approachingan open source community with your legal issues.

    The last year has seen significant changes to European Privacy. Last April theEU approved the GDPR, a comprehensive replacement for the European Privacyregime. The GDPR is a technology neutral regulation that has wide spreadimpacts on how individuals and business will use computers and the Internetworldwide. Free Software has an opportunity to help achieve the goal of theGDPR by baking in privacy and compliance into free software. This presentationwill talk about key elements of the GDPR that free software is positioned totake advantage of to increase adoption of free software and promote privacy.

    This presentation will discuss what the General Data Protection Regulation is,the scope of its impact, and how FOSS developers can align their efforts withthe GDPR to promote individual's privacy and on-line autonomy.

    Topics covered will include: what the GDPR is; who it applies to; andimportant legal rights such as the right to be forgotten, data portability,privacy by design and auditing requirements. By becoming aware of the demandsthe GDPR will be placing on organizations using FOSS, developers can invest inimprovements to their projects that help organizations comply in a way thatbenefits individuals.

    Many people, also software developers, put their inventions or innovations onthe 'market' without filing patents. For good reasons: the patent privilegesto exclude others are not really compatible with freedoms and openness.However, to protect your freedom to operate, you need to avoid that othersfile a patent on your invention. Open Patents are a new way to do this.

    Software patents are still a threat. When you publish your software code, acompany or a patent troll might file a patent for the inventions in your code.The patent offices should not grant patents for existing knowledge ('priorart'), but they will have a very hard time to find the ideas in your code. Assuch the troll might succeed in getting the patent, and might stop you andeveryone else from further exploitation of your ideas.

    Patents are a classical protection against patents, but it's an expensive andoverly offensive solution. Defensive publications are another solution. Butthis concept is not well known and doesn't get a lot of recognition. Theestablished implementations are commercial, have a per page publication feeand hide the defensive publications behind a paywall. The DefensivePublications program, a component of Linux Defenders, uses such commercialchannel, but waives the publication fee and republishes openly outside thepaywall. This solution is however for a very narrow (Free software) field andlacks the popularity it deserves.

    [The Open Patent Office](http://openpatentoffice.org/) is a non-profitorganization that aims to stimulate innovation by providing an open, free andsocial alternative to the traditional patent offices. It allows inventors toregister their innovative ideas as open patents. Open patents act as defensivepublications. The Open Patent Office publishes these descriptions, timestampsthem, gives them an open patent number, classifies them, facilitatesdiscussion and facilitates easy searching and finding by patent examiners andthe general public.

    Companies are using more free software than ever, but often with little or nounderstanding of the licenses or the community norms that are part of thepackage. When it comes to talking about free software legal tools, we need tocontrol the message. If we let other entities fill in the gaps in our outreachstrategy, a lot of context and nuance will be lost. A poor or incompletemessage hinders our ability to gain more widespread acceptance of freesoftware tools and practices.

    Suing collaborators or consciously working to erode well-established communitynorms for short term gain has no place in the world the free softwarecommunity is trying to build. Massive, globally useful, customizable softwareprojects aren't merely a side effect of publicly available repositories,they're a product of intentionally cooperative communities with rules andlegal safeguards. The FOSS community's message must be, "If you don't respectour legal tools, then you aren't a free or open source software company."

    Policy isn't made by coders. Official government policy is made by judges andlegislators and company policy is made by engaging with business and legalteams. We need to foster better understanding of our tools and norms amongstpolicy makers. This talk will offer ideas on how we should craft and deliverour message around the adoption of free software legal tools.

    The world of PKI and the interactions between browsers and CertificateAuthorities are very complex these days. We are creating a Trusted ServiceProvider (TSP) to deploy to the public reliable certificates for free, free asin "free beer". What are the requirements to deliver extended validatedcertificates? Why do you have to pay for it? What will be the price? Webelieve that it is one of our principle rights to secure our identity andprivacy in the digital space. You can't buy a basic right but you can organizean environment to make the best use of it.

    The talk gives an overview of our setup of a new Trusted Service Provider. Theheart of all is a non-profit organization in Austria which will lead somelegal bodies required to operate successfull. This NPO is open for all peoplewho accept the United Declaration of Human Rights. We think this is a keyfactor for success. But a NPO like this is not a Certificate Authority. Weneed another organisation to take over all tasks of a CA which has to pass anaudit with flying colours. A successfull performed audit is the key factor toplay a reliable role in the market. Certificates will be accepted. Trustbetween this CA and the end users will be established. Last but not least amoney flow must be organized. Individuals will get their certificates alwaysfor free. What about organizations? I will point out that a special kind ofassociation will do and will work. The software to operate the CA is developedfrom scratch. Of course the software will be published under a FLOSS license.

    As a FOSS/OSHW project grows, at some stage it often reaches a point where itrequires a legal entity for better operation – whether this be to gatherdonations, pay for development, handle finances, organise events, consolidaterights, better governance or other reasons. So far in Europe there were noalternatives to setting up your own legal entity, and with it a huge tonne ofwork and obligations.

    But finally three host/umbrella organisations have just emerged in Europe andaim to offload this overhead from your projects.

    Join our panel to learn if and which of these organisations could help yourproject flourish best, as well as pose any open questions or concerns you maystill have.

    Panelists include

    With the introduction of the Jigsaw module system many projects are confrontedwith issues running their code, now throwing new Exceptions likeInaccessibleObjectException because they used to work around issues in theJava API. Although many features like the famous sun.misc.Unsafe are nowprovided by other public APIs, there is still the problem of making your codework with previous Java versions, but also dynamically using the new Java 9replacements. Apache Lucene, the open source fulltext search library behindApache Solr and Elasticsearch, is also using some of those "hacks" to workaround issues in the Java API, but the developers also noticed that some codein the project hit some limits introduced by the module system. This talk willshow on some examples how Apache Lucene managed to allow its code to run withdifferent java versions (without using multi-release JAR files, as this bringsadditional burden with the build system) and still offer backwardscompatibility to earlier versions. It will show also the common pitfalls thatcan be easily found with running your tests in a security manager to uncoverbugs.

    Thermostat is a monitoring and management tool for Java deployments, allowingusers to measure and monitor a host of different performance aspects of theirJava applications. Available metrics range from raw CPU and memory usage tooperation of the Garbage Collector and JIT compiler through to thread activityand method call/heap profiles. Thermostat provides a GUI view of activity oflocal and distributed JVMs in a live-view or, alternatively, offline forafter-the-fact analysis.

    What Thermostat cannot do on its own is track events and record statisticsthat are specific to a given Java application, at least not unless theapplication co-operates with it, for example by publishing JMX statistics thatThermostat can read, persist and display in its GUI. However, that's about tochange thanks to work Thermostat developers have been doing to integrateByteman into Thermostat.

    Byteman is a tool which can be used to modify the behaviour of Java programsby injecting extra Java code almost anywhere in the program. You don't need torecompile your program or even prepare it in advance in order for this towork. You can specify changes to the program on the command line but, what ismore amazing, you can actually use Byteman to change the way a program runsafter startup while it is still running.

    In this talk we will show how Thermostat can collect and visualize metricswith Byteman's help in order to better understand a specific performance issuein a Java application.

    Garbage Collection (GC) liberates the programmer from having to call mallocand free. More importantly GC saves the programmer from having to debug theirmistakes when using malloc and free. Unfortunately the details of how GC worksare often a black box. This talk will start with a tour of all of the GCalgorithms currently available in OpenJDK. We'll discuss how they work, theirstrengths and weaknesses, and which class of applications they were developedfor. We'll work our way through serial gc, parallel gc, concurrent mark andsweep, and g1. We'll make the case for why we need all of them and just onemore GC algorithm, Shenandoah.

    Shenandoah is a parallel and concurrent GC algorithm designed for applicationswith 100gb+ heaps and tight pause time constraints. It's the first GCalgorithm targeting OpenJDK which compacts the live objects while the Javathreads are running. We'll describe the algorithm itself, the implementationdetails, and the optimizations needed to achieve good performance. We'llpresent performance numbers and give a demo that visualizes Shenandoah.

    In this presentation we present some optimizations we have developed for theMinio object server. To maximize hashing performances for bit-rot protectionwe have exploited the Go Assembly capabilities to natively optimizing BLAKE2and SHA2 techniques for both Intel and ARM platforms. In addition we willpresent a distributed locking package to aid with scaling a single serversolution into a multi server solution.

    In this presentation we would like to focus on a couple of developments thatwe have done for the Minio object server in terms of performance improvementsand scaling techniques.

    Regarding hashing we have developed Go packages for two hashing algorithms(BLAKE2 and SHA256) that take advantage of the Golang (or Plan9) assemblycapabilities. These packages exploit SIMD instructions of Intel and theCryptography Extensions for the ARM platform. The speed up range from 3 to 4times (Intel) to 100X (on ARM). Due to the use of Golang assembly there is noneed for a C-compiler in order to use these packages (when compiling fromscratch). For the Intel platform SSE, AVX, and AVX2 specific version areavailable and the most performant architecture is automatically chosen.

    In addition we have developed a distributed locking and syncing package forGo. Its main features are: \- Simple design for avoiding many tricky edgecases \- No need for a master node \- Resilient so other nodes are notaffected when a node goes down \- Drop-in replacement for sync.RWMutex-Automatically reconnect to (restarted) nodes \- Limited scalability of up to16 nodes

    We are successfully using this package for the Distributed version of theMinio Object Server

    Bugs, corrupt data or performance issues on web applications are oftenrecognized far too late. In the worst case they are reported by the customer,so they probably have already done some serious damage - frustrated the user,made them lose trust or even corrupted their data. Finding these bugs orrecognizing them early gets especially hard, if your application makes heavyuse of background processes, daemons or cronjobs. They might even throwexceptions that are buried somewhere in the logs, and no one will ever beaware of them, until someone has a look into the log files.

    I want to show a way out of this misery and provide different solutions inform of practical examples. These will include different levels of monitoring- from simple text logs on the servers up to a fully monitored applicationincluding hardware monitoring, extensive metrics, indexed and searchable logsof the whole environment, performance analysis and alerts if something oddhappens. I'll show different examples and give ideas when such a fullymonitored solution is a good idea, or when a "light monitoring" is applicable.

    [go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git) is a Git library written entirely inGo. It is designed to be developer-friendly and highly extensible. In thistalk we will introduce go-git, the reasons why we created it, its currentdevelopment status and its roadmap. We use go-git to fetch every Gitrepository that has been published (all GitHub, Bitbucket, self-hosted...) andanalyze all source code history and we hope that it can support many other usecases.

    go-git intends to be the way to go for Git with Go and a solid alternative tolibgit2 and jgit. Currently the library has 22k LOC's, has full read-featureparity with libgit2, has a dedicated team committed to it, and is the 3rd mostpopular git implementation. While it's still has a long way to go, we havealready used it to fetch and analyze 17M GitHub repositories, so it has a goodstability level for the feature set that we have implemented so far.Developers who are looking into building software to manipulate repositoriesat low level will find go-git a tool that can boost their productivity.

    Do you remember the time you spent an afternoon putting print statements inyour app trying to debug an issue and removed them before shipping the fix,only to add them back in a day later to work on another issue? Wouldn't it begreat if those debug statements could just stay in your code forever? Like alittle gift that keeps on giving, not just for you, but for everyone else onyour team too.

    That's what an application log is for! Logs aren't just for when things gowrong. They're for helping you to keep track of what's going on within yourapplication.

    We take a look at how you can add helpful messages throughout your codebaseand leave them there, even in production! We'll cover common loggingstrategies, log aggregation and how to efficiently work with your logs to getthe data back out again.

    We'll also take a look at metrics solutions such as Graphite that can helpaugment your logs to help work out what was going on by correlating event logswith peaks/drops in other monitoring systems.

    Working with time is not a trivial challenge. Python includes a native modulein the standard library to work with it but datetime keeps being together withunicode a common source of errors. This often leads to the widespread of manyother libraries in the attempt of easing the work of working with datetime.Datetime is one of those API that looks easy to use but given the manyconcepts around time, is it easy to get backfired if the developer has notsolid knowledge about the them.

    In this talk we will overview the main concepts about timestamps representedthrough datetime objects, the limitations on the standard library and somesimple steps to try to avoid the common mistakes that everyone can fall into.

    Naive datetimes (which the datetime API works by default with) are a greattool to represent calendar times, but when talking about timestamps (focus ofthis talk) timezones is n essential part of it and the datetime module can betricky to use for that use cases.

    We will also speak about different standards of time, time zones, DaylightSaving Times, leap seconds, serialization and datetime arithmetics.

    The talk will be focused on giving the foundations that everyone knows to beable to understand and work efficiently and without making painful mistakeswhen dealing with time related algorithms.

    # Audience

    All developers face a time when they have to work with datetime. This isclearly not a simple domain to just jump in to. The talk will help beginnersand intermediate developers to understand and don’t subestimate the complexityof working with time. The most experiences developers will also have some takeaways and pointers to further their grasp of this tricky field and gainconfidence on their daily usage of time related libraries.

    The talk will include explanations of what “time” actually means and how canwe represent it in python. You don't need to be an expert in datetime nor ISOstandards, the attendees will leave understanding the complexity of time, themain concepts behind datetime and a list of tips to represent timestamps withdatetime in a painless way. The talk will also include pointers to solutionsfor more complex problems like leap seconds, the [foldattribute](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0495/), etc.

    Key Takeaways: \- Calendar time vs Timestamps \- Representations of time \-Core ideas and tips around using datetime \- Pointers to advanced topics

    While python has developed into the lingua franca in Data Science there isoften a paradigm break when accessing specialized tools. In particular for oneof the core data categories in science and engineering, massive multi-dimensional arrays, out-of-memory solutions typically employ their own,different models.

    We discuss this situation on the example of the scalable open-source arrayengine, rasdaman ("raster data manager") which offers access to and processingof Petascale multi-dimensional arrays through an SQL-style array querylanguage, rasql. Such queries are executed in the server on a storage engineutilizing adaptive array partitioning and based on a processing engineimplementing a "tile streaming" paradigm to allow processing of arraysmassively larger than server RAM. The rasdaman QL has acted as blueprint forforthcoming ISO Array SQL and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) geoanalytics language, Web Coverage Processing Service, adopted in 2008. Notsurprisingly, rasdaman is OGC and INSPIRE Reference Implementation for their"Big Earth Data" standards suite.

    Recently, rasdaman has been augmented with a python interface which allows totransparently interact with the database (credits go to Siddharth Shukla'sMaster Thesis at Jacobs University). Programmers do not need to know therasdaman query language, as the operators are silently transformed, throughlazy evaluation, into queries. Arrays delivered are likewise automaticallytransformed into their python representation.

    The presenter is Principal Architect of rasdaman, editor of several "Big Data"standards, and co-chair of "Big Data" relevant working groups in several high-impact bodies. In the talk, the rasdaman concept will be illustrated with thehelp of large-scale real-life examples of operational satellite image andweather data services, and sample python code will be demonstrated live.

    Algebraic operator are every where in python. + = * / Dict are every where inpython.

    What can we achieve by combining both of them?

    [Slides](http://jul.github.io/cv/pres.html#/init) are here

    ## Introduction

    Algebra is a wonderful abstraction that make the infamous 2D point example ofa class or nameddict useless when you have complex data type (that is HWaccelerated on Intel CPU).

    ## I Algebra 101 : it is all about consistency between symbol and behaviour

    Simple: Is something consistent with linear algebra? it requires 17 simpleunit tests suffice to say so

    So just let makes a test this rules are followed, and then a class thatapplies these behaviours and we have implemented it.

    ## II I have linear algebra behaviour. How useful can it be?

    Well, you have basic data type like { x: 1, y :2, z :3 } that is actuallybehaving like an euclidean vector.

    If an object is a MutableMapping thus we can create a universal operator forsaying how much an object «looks like» another one. Practical use :

      * finding doublons in database;  * text matching (after a pass of ntlk + word counters);  * pattern fitting;

    ...

    That is the basis of Textual indexation and profiling (it is not only for evilpurpose) https://github.com/jul/ADictAdd _iction/blob/master/example/cos_demo.py

    ## III State of the art of 2 working POC how to use MutableMapping (dict) andsuper

    Most of the operation tested here https://github.com/jul/ADictAdd_iction/

    Implementation as a trait here https://github.com/jul/archery

    Basically it works BUT :

      1. it is hard : with archery I stumbled on super  2. with VectorDict (obsolete) it lacks of genericity and the code is clumsy  3. python 2 div behaviour was screwing this (and since these library were relying on base operator, I got biten)

    Prepare to throw 2 away

    ## IV the future

    A chain is as strong as its weakest link : if a lib is based on composing thepython based operator, the algebra will be as consistent as the CORE behaviourof the operator in the language.

    ## Conclusion

    Algebra is a powerful abstraction that is still underused.

    Possible development : \- Rieman/Hermitian algebra: using the power of themath used in Quantum Mechanics/relativity and python in the same fashion \-Using Quaternion to have quirkless rotation in euclidean 3D...

    After introducing the Kinto project I am working on, I will explain why pushnotifications can be useful in the web environment and how I integrated theweb push API in Python in Kinto as well as on the client using serviceworkers.

    What is Kinto? Kinto is a minimalist JSON storage service with synchronisationand sharing abilities. It is easy to use and to self-host. Kinto is used anddeveloped at Mozilla and released under the Apache v2 licence.

    Why use Kinto? Kinto lets you focus on writing great user-facing interfacesand takes care of storing, sharing and synchronizing your application statewith multiple devices or users. It is often a big deal for developers todevelop web APIs that handle CORS, are secure, respect users privacy bysupporting encryption when building applications that work offline, store dataremotely, and synchronise across devices. Existing solutions either rely onbig corporations that crave user data, or require a non-trivial amount of timeand expertise to develop a new server for every new project. We want to helpdevelopers focus on their business logic and value proposition, and we don’twant the challenge of storing user data or developing backends to get in theirway. The path between a new idea and deploying to production should be short!Also, we are firm believers of the fact that data belongs to users, and notnecessarily to the application authors. Applications should be decoupled fromthe storage location, and users should be able to choose where their personaldata is stored. The backend can often be universal, generic and reusable. Weenvision mutualisation of services and self-hosting: the backend is deployed,secured and scaled only once for several applications, which is amazing!

    Why Web Push? Push notifications allow users to opt-in to timely updates fromthe sites they love and allow you to effectively re-engage them with not onlycustomized and engaging content but also enable real time interactions withother users of the application, realtime updates and real time data sharingthrough websockets With Web Push, the notification payload is encrypted by theserver sending the notification which makes it really secure and privacyaware. Web push is a browser API feature so that you don't need to pay or todeploy anything on the server side to have it working out of the box.

    HOW TO PUSH:

    What is a service worker? A service worker is a worker working in thebackground of your browser that can handle events for a given origin and path.It takes the form of a JavaScript file that can control the web page/site itis associated with. They will also allow handling of push notification eventsand background sync APIs. Service workers keep working after the page orwebsite is closed and between browser restarts.

    How to use push notifications? On the client side, it means to setup a serviceworker and to get a subscription for the user browser. The resultingPushSubscription includes all the information that the application needs to beable to send a push message: an endpoint and the encryption key needed forauthenticating and encrypting the data.

    What is the Kinto Push Service? In the Kinto use case, all users of the sameweb application will probably want to receive notifications informing themabout the creation, updation or deletion of a collection or a record fromanother device. Each device will have its own subscription endpoint andencryption key and the payload will need to be sent to each one of them. Myproject was about creating a service that can handle subscriptions managementand notification broadcast for a given channel. When the web applicationstarts, it will start a service worker that will be configured to receive pushnotification and sent them back to all the active browser pages of the webapplication. The application will call the push service to register the pushsubscription on some events. A Kinto plugin will be triggered each time theapplication collection changes and it will call the ‘send the notifications’on the push service channel. The push service will get the notification,encrypt it and publish it to all the subscriptions for that user.

    Role of the PushAPI: \- So, once you’ve got the permission for notifs,registered the service worker and suscribed to push notifs! Congratulations,major breakthrough has been achieved already. \- Send the endpoint associatedwith the subscription and generate a client public key(PushSubscription.endpoint and PushSubscription.getKey()) to the server so itcan send push message when required. \- Using the Channel Messaging API set upa new message channel (MessageChannel.MessageChannel()) to communicate withthe service worker and by calling Worker.postMessage() on the service worker,in order to open up the communication channel. \- On the server side, storethe endpoint and any other required details so they are available when a pushmessage needs to be sent to a push subscriber. In a production app, it needsto be made sure that these details are kept hidden, so malicious parties can'tsteal endpoints and spam subscribers with push messages. \- To send a pushmessage, an HTTP POST is sent to the endpoint URL. The request must include aTTL header that limits how long the message should be queued if the user isnot online. To include payload data in the request, it must be encrypted(which involves the client public key). Encryption is a complex process, so wecan choose to use libraries which handles all the hard work.

    Scientific aircraft research flights have to be planned beforehand. For thatit is necessary to have model forecasts of relevant quantities such asmeteorological parameters, chemical composition or particle information toguide the aircraft to the location of interest. Typically, many scientificinstruments on board those aircrafts used to investigate e.g. the chemicalcomposition of the air in order to get new insights often with the involvementof different science groups.

    For discussion of the possibilites of the research flights, the MissionSupport System (MSS) was developed. This software helps to review a big amountof metereological and model data by viewing the forecasted parameters ofinterest along possible regions of a proposed flight path. Data and possibleflight paths can be displayed on a hoizontal view (map projection) or on avertical view (along the proposed flight path). Flight paths can beconstructed and modified on these views. Exchange through a waypoint table isalso possible.

    The talk gives a brief insight into the MSS software development currentstate.

    We are using the OWS interface standard. https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/MSS is a client/server application. The QT client interacts with a paste wsgiserver. The software is available for all platforms on conda-forge.

    Tanker goal is to allow easy batch operations without compromising databasemodeling. For pandas users, it's like DataFrame.to_sql on steroids.

    The Tanker inception is based on two strong observations (not particularlynew):

      * The object-relation mapping in so called libraries is sometimes source of performance and semantic difficulties, especially with queries involving multiple joins. On the other hand, the relational model is both powerful and simple, and there are no reason not to expose it to the Python world.

      * When working with external data sources, we are often faced with the challenge of matching those records with the database content. We have to know which record is new, which has been updated, etc. We also often have to de-normalize content and map it with a (hopefully) well-designed and 3NF schema.

    This presentation will show how Tanker answers those two aspects, how it wasinspired by existing libraries and how it is currently used in productionapplications.

    What should be done of the PTags Linux Security Module?

    PTags means Process-Tags, it allows to tag processes and is compatible withuser namespaces.

    What problem does it solves? How does it works? How can it be used and forwhat purposes?

    Answers to these questions would allows to answer the main question: should itbe part of linux tree?

    PTags allows a system to attach tags to processes. The tags can receivevalues. The semantic of tags and of the values is not enforced and that is thebig strength of that model that can be widely used for several purposes.

    This talk will answer the following questions: \- What problem does it solves?\- How does it works? (including user namespace) \- How can it be used and forwhat purposes?

    It firstly came from studies on "user land" capabilities attached to APIs. Butas the process of tagging can be more widely used in system, it became moregeneric and simply solve the problem of attaching data (or meta-data) to aprocess and its possibly forked children.

    It works by writing or reading the file /proc/PID/attr/ptags. When reading thefile, the tag list is read. When writing the file, the tag list can be changedunder conditions. The file can be monitored using inotify to be alerted onwrite accesses that presumely change the content. An available C libraryimplements common operations.

    The implementation is aware of user namespace. It can thus be used safely incontainers because a same process is able to expose different tags indifferent namespaces, depending on there history.

    Examples will show that it can be used for: \- managing capabilities in theuser land \- setting cookies on processes \- publishing, or exposing, data orstate of a process \- passing data without IPC \- managing lifecycle ofprocesses \- tracking forks \- ...

    1.Introduction to footprinting I will comment the main footprinting phases:

    Passive Footprinting where we collect public information and building a map ofthe server or domain objective, without interacting directwith it.

    Active Footprinting where there is an active target identification through andtechniques such as port scanning, and different identifications of services,operating systems and server banners.

    2.Footprinting tools

    For applying footprinting techniques we can use tools for obtain domaininformation such as whois,apply inverse querys from DNS and name servers. Alsowe can use third services such as robtex and serversniff for obtain moreinformation. We can use public information sources,between these tools we canhighlight shodan,scans,zmap and censys

    3.Port scanning with nmap

    With nmap we can check ports open for a target ip or domain and with nmapscripts we can check vulnerabilities in open ports For example,if the mysqlport is opened,check if the server has some vulnerability relationed with thisservice.I will show nmap scripts for checking this vulnerabilities.

    While there have been many improvements around securing containers, there isstill a large gap in monitoring the behavior of containers in production.That’s why we created Sysdig Falco, the open source behavioral activitymonitor for containerized environments.

    Sysdig Falco can detect and alert on anomalous behavior at the application,file, system, and network level. In this session get a deep dive into Falco:\- How does behavioral security differ from existing security solutions likeimage scanning? \- How does Falco work? \- What can it detect? Building andcustomizing rules \- Next steps

    It's a talk about MITM in Tunneled Authentication Protocols and its consequentimplementation with a help of hostap project. The research is not original andyou may find a deeper overview in the paper: Pieter Robyns, Bram Bonné, PeterQuax, Wim Lamotte, Exploiting WPA2-enterprise vendor implementation weaknessesthrough challenge response oracles, July 2014.

    There is a lot of information about hijacking internet connection. The mosttrivial case is unencrypted (open) wireless connection. But it is stillpossible if the network is protected with WPA/WPA2-Enteprise.

    Three days work was sufficient to modify the behaviour of MSCHAPv2 and a bitof PEAP methods in EAP state machine within hostap. In the end, proof-of-concept simulation demonstrates the attack flow.

    It is reasonable, since this code base is widely spread and up-to-date, what'seven more important. Hence, it is a very good sandbox for EAP attacks.

    Panopticon is a graphical disassembler written in Rust that runs on GNU/Linux,Windows and OS X. It aims to create a free replacement for tools like IDA Proand BinDiff.

    Analysis of closed source applications is necessary for security practitionersand FLOSS-developers. Roughly 1/3 of the FSF High Priority Projects willlikely involve analysis of binary applications, on top of the dedicatedreverse engineering projects. Yet, the majority of the tools to do this areclosed source themselves. This problem extends to academia where the lack ofstable and extensible binary analysis tools forces scientist to implementtheir prototypes on top of proprietary software. This further hampers adoptionof the -- publicly funded -- research by practitioners.

    The Panopticon project aims to develop a tool to end the dominance ofproprietary software for reverse engineering. What sets Panopticon apart fromother free disassembler is that we believe an intuitive GUI is paramount toaid human analysts to understand as much of the binary as possible. As suchPanopticon comes with an Qt 5 UI written in QML that allows browsing andannotating control flow graphs. Panopticon implements semantic-based analysisto resolve dynamic jumps and calls. We believe that a disassembler that knowsassembly code semantics allows automation of common reverse engineering tasksand provide aids for manual analysis.

    The talk will touch on the vision and architecture of Panopticon. The targetaudience are reverse engineers interested in FLOSS tools and/or advancedstatic analysis as well as developers who want to contribute to the project.

    Event logging is a central source of information for IT security. The syslog-ng application collects logs from many different sources, performs real-timelog analysis by processing and filtering them, and finally it stores the logsor routes them for further analysis. This session focuses on how syslog-ngparses important information from incoming messages, enriches them withadditional contextual information, and concludes with demonstrating how all ofthis can be used for alerting or for dashboards.

    Event logging is a central source of information for IT security. The syslog-ng application collects logs from many different sources, performs real-timelog analysis by processing and filtering them, and finally it stores the logsor routes them for further analysis. In an ideal world, all log messages comein a structured format, ready to be used for log analysis, alerting ordashboards. But in a real world only part of the logs belong to this category.Traditionally, most of the log messages come as free format text messages.These are easy to be read by humans, which was the original use of logmessages. However, today logs are rarely processed by the human eye.Fortunately syslog-ng has several tools to turn unstructured and many of thestructured message formats into name-value pairs, and thus delivers thebenefits of structured log messages. Once you have name-value pairs, logmessages can be further enriched with additional information in real-time,which helps responding to security events faster. One way is adding geo-location based on IP addresses. Another way is adding contextual data fromexternal files, like the role of a server based on the IP address or the roleof the user based on the name. Data from external files can also be used tofilter messages, for example to check firewall logs to determine whethercertain IP addresses are contained in various black lists for malware commandcenters, spammers, and so on. Logging is subject to an increasing number ofcompliance regulations. PCI-DSS or many European privacy laws require removingsensitive data from log messages. I will demonstrate how logs can beanonymized in a way that they are still useful for security analitics. At theend I would like to introduce you to the basics of syslog-ng configuration,and demonstrate how the collected logs can be used for alerting or visualizedon a dashboard.

    While troubleshooting MySQL performance problems it is important to find outwhere CPU time is spent inside mysqld process. The process of investigationshould have as small influence as possible on the server we try totroubleshoot. Ideally, the source code should be instrumented for that.

    Performance_schema introduced in MySQL 5.5 is supposed to provide detailedenough instrumentation. But it comes with a cost, require careful sizing ofperformance counters, and the process of instrumenting the code is not yetcomplete even for MySQL itself, to say nothing about 3rd party storageengines, plugins and libraries like Galera.

    This is when profilers come handy. Poor Man's Profiler (PMP, aka pt-pmp), perfand oprofile on Linux can be easily used while studying MySQL performanceproblems. Basic usage steps are presented and several typical use cases arediscussed.

    In case of any performance problems with MySQL is important to find out whereCPU time is spent inside mysqld process. Is it waiting on disk I/O, some lockor internal mutex, or maybe it performs complex computation that should beoptimized? You can not figure out until you know how much time each importantstep takes, and how often it occurs. To investigate that, one may usedifferent tools and approaches, from tracing the code to using simple OS levelutilities that show disk and memory usage in total or per device, to moreadvanced programs that collect all kinds of information about specific programrunning (these are often called profilers). The process of investigationshould have as small influence as possible on the server we try totroubleshoot.

    Ideally, the source code should be instrumented for that and provide a"domain-specific" performance metrics. It may be not enough to know how muchtime specific function runs if its code is huge and complex.Performance_schema introduced in MySQL 5.5 was supposed to provide detailedenough instrumentation. But it comes with a cost (performance penalty, thatcan be notable), require careful sizing of performance counters, forceinvestigator to use advanced SQL to get the information needed. What's evenworse, the process of instrumenting the code is not yet complete even forMySQL itself, to say nothing about 3rd party storage engines, plugins andlibraries like Galera.

    Apache Spark is a cluster computing framework, similar to Apache Hadoop. Thereare a number of tasks where MySQL does not show great performance: for exampleMySQL is not massively parallel system and a single query will only utilize 1CPU core . Spark, on the the other hand is designed to be massively parallel;in addition Spark is a clustering framework, so you can easily add morecompute nodes so that Spark can utilize more resources and scale.

    Apache Drill is similar project aimed to make data discovery easier. Forexample it allow you to join data sources in MySQL, MongoDB, flat files, otherRDBMS, etc.

    In this talk I will demonstrate how to use Apache Spark together with MySQLfor data analysis. I will sho how Apache Spark aggregates data (wikipediapageview statistics) and stores the resultset in MySQL.

    Redundancy is the prominent technique for creating resilient, highly availableservices. MySQL has had a quite mature and feature rich replication solutionfor over a decade now. Moreover, there are interesting new features that allowusers to create quite advanced setups. Nowadays, there is group replication,multi-source replication, and of course plain asynchronous replication thatallow users to create interesting new setups.

    In this session we will present recommended ways to mix and match groupreplication with regular asynchronous replication. We will show how the usercan combine both to create simple upgrade/migration paths to complex setups.We will also show specifically on group replication what is the recommendedprocedure to provision and deploy replicas and detail what happens behind thescenes when a replica joins the group.

    Window functions are an important tool for analytical queries. Windowfunctions act as regular functions but have access to more than one row duringcomputation. This makes them highly useful for optimising queries involvingself-joins, as well as queries that need to extract data from multiple relatedrows from the same table. The performance speedups obtained are sometimes 100fold. This talk will explain how that is possible, as well as use cases forwindow functions.

    On top of that, window functions pair well with another feature that MariaDB10.2 has introduced - Common Table Expressions. This feature was contributedby a community member and helps make queries more maintainable and sometimesfaster. This feature will be covered, mostly through the use of windowfunctions, but also introduce new use cases.

    The agenda for the talk is:

      * What are CTEs  * What are window functions  * Solving problems with regular SQL and window functions  * Smoothing data  * Top-N Queries  * Difference between consecutive rows

In this talk, we will talk about the performance impact of“environmental” MySQL tuning, where the tuning is neither at the SQL level(like creating indexes or using different table structures), nor with settingMySQL parameters (tuning parameters like innodb _buffer_ pool _size or innodb_log _file_ size even more obscure ones like innodb _lru_ scan_depth). Instead,in the talk we will cover the following areas (we won’t limit the talk tothese):

      * Operating system level tuning opportunities  * Compiling MySQL: does it worth to build your own from the performance perspective?  * Building MySQL with different compilers  * Building MySQL with profile-guided optimization  * Impact of using different memory allocators  * CPU and memory affinity with running multiple instances

    DAMP: Docker is the component that makes the whole environment portable (onlybash and Docker needed to set it up) Ansible is an agentless config managementsystem that makes the whole setup automated and painless ProxySQL is a risingstar on MySQL's horizon giving full control to DBAs over queries before theyhit the DBs. MHA is an proven MySQL HA solution that's easily customizable

    My aim with this demo/repo is to show people how easy to set up a testenvironment with to test a really good MySQL HA/Proxy solution.

    Attendees will gain insight into how to leverage Ansible plays to automatemany tasks for managing a highly available MySQL environment with the abilityof read/write split, load balancing, on-the-fly query rewrite(ProxySQL). We'regoing to demonstrate scenarios like: \- Building HA environment in 3 minutes\- ProxySQL auto dynamic config generation with Ansible \- failover withoutlosing a single SELECT

    A fully working Ansible playbook will be available for the attendees runningin Docker

    The revolt against SQL continues at a steady but considerably slower pace.Bespoke database software seems to crop up daily in the name of performance orfunctionality. This talk will examine the ever growing field of monitoringsystems and their respective databases, and look in depth as to how Postgrescan be used in a number of these places. Systems of this nature are typicallytasked with collecting and storing metrics from your infrastructure, drawingpretty graphs, and nagging you when things break.

    Forms of data stored by these systems are nothing to be afraid of - they ofteninclude: \- Time series metrics - the history of a measurement over time, e.g.temperatures \- Logs - unstructured text emitted by applications, operatingsystems and hardware \- Events - schema-less but well structured notifications

    An assertion of this talk is that for a majority of use cases, Postgres ismore than capable of storing all of this data. We will attempt to replacenumerous well known pieces of software with just one Postgres database. Ofcourse we are told to use the right tool for the job, but having to learn andoperate a single tool is a huge operational advantage.

    We’ll get quite technical in this talk, take a look the data models and accesspatterns required, and how this can be fitted into the general purposeenvironment of Postgres. Additionally, it is always constructive to look atwhat can be problematic, and not just focus on the positives, and why manyturn to other bespoke solutions.

    PostgreSQL is an awesome project and it evolves at an amazing rate. The talkwill focus on evolution of fault tolerance capabilities in PostgreSQLthroughout its versions.

    The talk will cover the topics listed below:

      * Robustness of PostgreSQL  * PostgreSQL Fault Tolerance: WAL  * Transaction? Commit? Checkpoint?  * Replication Methods for PostgreSQL  * Physical Replication  * Standby Modes  * Streaming Replication and WAL  * Failover and Switchover  * Synchronous Commit  * Managing Timeline Issues: pg_rewind  * Trigger-based Replication  * Logical Decoding : BDR and pglogical

    There are several ways of how to look at fault tolerance. In this sensePostgreSQL provides different means of achieving fault tolerance anddependability either out of the box solutions or using extensions depending onwhat are the user’s priorities about their system. General fault tolerance inPostgreSQL is improving over time and I expect this trend to continue.

    Ever wondered what might be the best data type for a certain use case? Is itbetter to use INTEGER or BIGINT, and should you use TIMESTAMP or is it betterto use TIMESTAMPTZ? When is the last time you migrated a legacy database andwondered what to use as replacement for VARCHAR2 or CHAR(255)? How to store IPaddresses or geographical data, does that fit into VARCHAR or is theresomething more suitable?

    PostgreSQL 9.6 comes with around 40 different data types preinstalled. Thistalk looks beyond INTEGER and VARCHAR and dives into some of the lesser knownPostgreSQL data types. Use cases and examples show which data type is a goodfit for a certain situation.

    Software Defined Networks (SDNs) usually involve programmable switches withlimited autonomy of decision, that heavily rely on the instructions of theircontroller to handle “exceptions” and to adapt to traffic evolution. In anattempt to bring back some of the dataplane logic from the controller to theprogrammable switches, the [OpenState](https://beba-eu.github.io/) abstractionlayer has been designed, to enable efficient stateful packet processingthrough programmable actions occurring at the switch level.

    The first part of this talk in an introduction to OpenState and includes adescription of the layer as well as some example use cases. Then theimplementation prototypes of OpenState realized during the project will bepresented. One, in particular, will get more focus: because[eBPF](https://www.iovisor.org/blog/2016/04/12/exploring-ebpf-io-visor-and-beyond) (extended version of Berkeley Packet Filter) can be stateful and hasbeen conceived to reach high performances for inline packet filtering andprocessing, we found it to be an excellent target for OpenState.

    As for the background: the work around OpenState (and its extended version,Open Packet Processor) has been achieved in the context of the[BEBA](http://www.beba-project.eu/) research project (Horizon 2020), thattackles dataplane programmability for SDNs. Started in January 2015 andclosing in March 2017, this project has entered its final stage, mostlycentered on functional and performance tests for the validation of thedeveloped prototypes.

    The Transport Layer Development Kit (TLDK) is new Layer 4 implementation,developed for DPDK (dpdk.org) and VPP (https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP).

    TCP and UDP socket based applications are core technologies in the moderndata-center. The introduction of Orchestration, SDN controllers, vSwitches andVirtual Dataplane have seen a huge change in how network packets are deliveredto data-centre nodes. While the stacks that consume these packets, the socketbased applications have evolved much more slowly. Virtual switches like VPPand OVS-DPDK, have benefited from the vector packet processing technology inDPDK to scale process millions of packets per second, while TCP and UDP socketbased applications have not yet benefited. There have been a number recentefforts to port various L4 implementations to DPDK, and while these usuallygive a modest performance benefit the performance of these is not yetrevolutionary.

    TLDK has been developed from the ground up to be a very fast and scalable UDPand TCP implementation, targeted for use with DPDK and VPP. In thispresentation will provide an overview of TLDK design and implementation. Thisdeep-dive will include:-

      * Overview of the TLDK UDP and TCP API, and how it differs from the BSD Sockets API.  * How TLDK scales DOS prevention mechanisms such as SynCookie and SynCache.  * How TLDK scales TCP Timers to handle millions of connections per core.  * How TLDK integrates with Virtual Switches likes VPP?  * How will existing TCP and UDP based applications such as NGINX or Apache Traffic Server benefit from TLDK?

    Overview of 5G, network slicing, and OpenAirInterface

    One of the interesting aspects of the 4G/5G era is confluence between theopen-source software-defined networking technologies used in mainstream fixednetworks and the closed-source technologies used the access and corecomponents of cellular networks. This poses significant challenges from alegal standpoint because of the required mix of the two software technologiesin common data centers. This conflictual relationship is aggravated furtherwith the emergence of mobile edge computing. Once the legal issues areultimately resolved, as it seems to be the case, the main issue will be thatof satisfying real-time processing constraints for the radio-access networkfunctions. These stem from the latency requirements of cellular systems whenthe radio-access procedures are executed on commodity servers. Moreover, whennetwork function virtualization is put into the picture to allow fortechniques such as network slicing to descend down in the radio-accessnetwork, the situation becomes even more challenging from a real-timeperspective.

    This talk will provide an overview of the evolution of 4G networks towards 5Gand some of he new applications and industries that will be enabled by it. Wealso cover the role of the OpenAirInterface Software Alliance and how it istrying to soften the blow of clash between open and closed-source communitiesin radio-access and core networks along with its relationship with some of theother related open-source communities. The talk will also cover some technicalaspects related to the difficulties in virtualizing radio-access networkfunctions on commodity servers when it comes to real-time requirements,orchestration and management.

    GlusterD-2.0 (GD2) is a new implementation of the GlusterFS management daemon,which attempts to fix a lot of issues with the current management daemon.

    This talk will give the listeners an overview of the problems that GD2 isattempting to solve and how it solves them.

    GlusterFS is a highly modular distributed filesystem. The translator modelused by GlusterFS allows new filesystem features to be easily developed andincluded in GlusterFS.

    But the GlusterFS management daemon, GlusterD, makes it hard for developers toactually get their new features into the hands of end users. Almost any newfilesystem feature needs to have code written for it in GlusterD to ensure itis actually available for use. GlusterD, unlike the rest of GlusterFS, is asingle monolithic, with a very large, undocumented and hard to navigate codebase. This makes it very hard for feature developers to integrate theirfeature in GlusterD. In addition to this, GlusterD makes it harder forGlusterFS to scale, harder to integrate with external projects and takes up alot of maintenance effort.

    GlusterD-2.0 (GD2) is a ground up re-implementation of the management daemon,designed from the beginning to overcome the above problems. GD2 and itsinternal frameworks are designed to be flexible, extensible and pluggable. GD2makes it easier for developers to integrate their newer features intoGlusterFS as well as allow easier integration of GlusterFS and other projects.In this talk, we'll be covering how GD2 and the new frameworks work to solvethe problems above.

    This talk will be useful for developers interested in working on/withGlusterFS, users who want to understand how GlusterFS manages itself andpeople with a general interest in management and distributed systems.

    While containers themselves are stateless many applications still haverequirements on storage that should persist across containers and instances ofcontainers. Many such storage solutions require an administrator to set up astorage solution on hardware outside their existing container platforms.GlusterFS changes all that.

    GlusterFS is a software-defined, distributed, and scale-out filesystem. Recentdevelopments have made it possible to deploy GlusterFS as a containerizedapplication on your existing container platform (e.g. Kubernetes, OpenShift)thus allowing for a hyper-converged storage solution that only requires havingstorage devices attached to your nodes.

    In this session we will cover how GlusterFS was containerized, how to deployit, and how it can provide persistent storage for other containerizedapplications.

    Non-Volatile-Memory express (NVMe) standard promises and order of magnitudefaster storage than regular SSDs, while at the same time being more economicalthan regular RAM on TB/$. This talk evaluates the use cases and benefits ofNVMe drives for its use in Big Data clusters with HBase and Hadoop HDFS.

    First, we benchmark the different drives using system level tools (FIO) to getmaximum expected values for each different device type and set expectations.Second, we explore the different options and use cases of HBase storage andbenchmark the different setups. And finally, we evaluate the speedups obtainedby the NVMe technology for the different Big Data use cases from the YCSBbenchmark.

    In summary, while the NVMe drives show up to 8x speedup in best casescenarios, testing the cost-efficiency of new device technologies is notstraightforward in Big Data, where we need to overcome system level caching tomeasure the maximum benefits.

    GlusterFS is an open source, software defined scale out distributed filesystemwhich resides in user-space and typical runs on any commodity hardware. It hasa stackable architecture so that it is very easy to introduce a new feature.When storage (in any sort) comes into picture, security and privacy are twoimportant features which are of concern to everyone. SELinux is one among thetrending facilities which provides both. From the server-side view GlusterFSworks well in SELinux environments, but this does not address SELinux supportfor the contents stored on Gluster volumes. This presentation will cover onestep further; how an end user can use SELinux context over Gluster volumes. Inthe world of Storage As a Service this is a feature that everyone will love tohave.

    This talk will cover two open source technologies SELinux and GlusterFS.GlusterFS is software defined storage. SELinux otherwise known as SecurityEnhanced Linux is security module available in linux kernel through whichsecurity policies can be defined. Although it is widely used in linux world ,no one has tried it with a distributed file system.So why it is important forsoftware defined storage or in distribute storage ? The user specific securityoptions available for end user is always limited(one of them is acl). First ofall it is an additional security flavor for the end user. From a point ofstorage as a service, it is one of the key security feature which an end usercan directly use. There are different clients which tries to provide thisfacility. In case of NFS, Labeled NFS is effort put on nfsv4 protocol whichavails the same.

    The entire talk covers how SELinux feature can be implemented in a distributedfile system, taking GlusterFS as an example. GlusterFS has a stackablearchitecture so that we can easily plug this feature. Each layer in this stackis known as translator. In case of SELinux a new translator will introduced atserver side. The SELinux context are stored at backend as extended attributesnamed as "security.selinux". So this translator will handle all thegetxattr/setxattr calls from the clien. Another important point to be noted isthere will SELinux context for gluster process in Linux environments. So thiscontexts should be mess up with files stored in gluster volumes.

    This project is planned for gluster 3.10 release. So it will be a goodplatform to get early feedback/suggestion/contribution for this feature.

    If you need to manage more then a reasonably sized infrastructure in today'sday and age you will want to automate things as much as possible. In order todo that properly, you'll need to use tools that help you manage yourinfrastructure. This poses a problem: before you can manage yourinfrastructure, you now need to manage the infrastructure you will use tomanage your infrastructure. The interesting bit is that if you use industrybest practices, a lot of that management infra will look the same or similaracross organisations. So why do we need to reinvent the weel over and over?

    This talk will present OpsTheater, a stack of tools used to manage aninfrastructure made up of current industry best practices (Puppet, GitLab,Icinga, ELK stack). OpsTheater is a fully open source project that was startedin late 2015 and is growing to be a great set of tools that takes away thework we do over and over: managing the infrastructure to manage ourinfrastructure. We will look at the problems OpsTheater solves, the state ofthe project and what you can do with it today. If you want to help, we'll showwhere you an go and what you can do. If time permits, a demo will be addedshowing some of the things we can do with OpsTheater.

Handling different systems is most presentwhen writing the scripts that perform tasks on the clients. Similarities anddifferences that administrators may face when creating these scripts areimportant for the creation and will be highlighted during that talk.

    Config management is a perfect fit for compliance: you model desired compliantstate, continually enforce it and have a full audit path of when changes occurand what lead to the drift. But what are the best practises for using configmanagement for compliance, what are the caveats, how do you scan for issuesand how can you keep the auditors happy?

    If you work with or at a Telco, Financial Institution or a Government entity,you probably already know about compliance and the various acronyms andheadaches it can bring.

    How can we make this less of a painful process?

    Well, if you think about it: compliance is a set of rules that someone hasgiven you to enforce and prove that they're being enforced. What isconfiguration management? A series of rules for systems that need to beenforced. So compliance is the perfect use-case for configuration management.

    We'll be discussing how you can enforce compliance in your estate with configmanagement, what open-source tooling you to perform scans across your estateand how to save time by leveraging existing work such as http://dev-sec.io.

    We'll also be talking about how to sell the benefits of config management forcompliance to stakeholders and some real-life examples of how it's worked withcustomers in the past, and the caveats that come with it.

Using octocatalog-diff (from GitHub) andTheForeman (using a new plugin) we can now view these changes up front, in theUI, _before_ switching the agent to the new env.

    Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to be given at 11:00 Thetalk originally in this slot, "Next Generation Config Mgmt" by James Shubinwill now take place at 11:00.

    Octocatalog-diff is a commandline tool to show the differences between twopuppet environments for a specific node _before_ the node is moved to the newenv. That's great, but not everyone wants to work on the commandline

    In this talk we'll look at a new Foreman plugin (foreman-puppetdiff) whichbrings this functionality to the Foreman UI. We'll cover the basics ofoctocatalog-diff (installation, uses, limitations) and then show how to set upthe Foreman plugin and use it in the UI.

    Magnum is an OpenStack service offering Container Clusters as a service, withsupport for Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos or DC/OS. Users of the service candeploy clusters of thousands of nodes in minutes, and access them securelyusing their native APIs.

    In the first part of this talk we introduce the Magnum service. We present itsbasic and more advanced features, including support for heterogeneousclusters, cluster upgrades, cluster drivers and the ongoing effort to make itrock solid.

    Next, you can get idea if how Magnum is integrated in CERN’s cloudinfrastructure. How it started as a pilot service, the efforts done to addmissing features and how CERN’s users benefit from it. CERN’s use casesinclude end user physics analysis, web services, continuous integration,infrastructure services and more.

    Finally, such a complex service needs to be tested and benchmarked in depth,so the last section includes the results of a series of tests done in CERNcloud infrastructure and the CNCF testing infrastructure scaling the differentcontainer orchestration engines to thousands of nodes. Specifically, we reportresults of running several thousand containers in Kubernetes and scaling aservice to millions of requests a second.

    In this talk, we'll illustrate the Operator concept, showing how Operators arebuilt atop the Kubernetes third-party resources mechanism with a closeexamination of the open source etcd Operator. We'll demonstrate the Operatorin action, deploying an etcd key-value store cluster atop Kubernetes, thenscaling and replicating etcd pods in response to load and in the face of podand node failures. The audience will learn how to deploy the etcd Operator andhow to begin developing Operators to manage their own stateful applications.

    Singularity is an open source container solution being developed specificallyfor HPC environments. With Singularity, HPC users can safely bring their ownexecution environments to the cluster. Unlike other container solutions,Singularity does not require root level permissions to run containers, whichallows users to freely control what software stack they wish to use.Provisioning of a container image can be done locally on the user's machine oron Singularity Hub. The resulting image can then be securely executed on anymachine with Singularity installed. Reproduction of results has never beeneasier: a user can now share a single Singularity image file that will ensurea consistent execution environment wherever it is run.

    This presentation will provide an in-depth look at how Singularity is able tosecurely run user containers on HPC systems. After a brief introduction toSingularity and its relationship to other container solutions, the details ofSingularity's runtime will be explored. The way that Singularity leveragesLinux features such as namespaces, bind mounts, and SUID binaries will bediscussed in further detail as well.

    This talk will describe the NBD protocol: what is it, what can it do, and whyis it relevant for virtualization and IaaS. We will also touch at a fewfeatures that have been specified for the protocol, but so far have not beenimplemented in any known implementation.

    The Network Block Device (NBD) was originally written for the Linux kernel, touse and export block devices over a network (TCP) link. Its feature set wasvery limited, however, which limited its practical usability for manypurposes. Over the years, however, the protocol has evolved, with featuressuch as better negotiation, improved reliability through flush requests, andawareness of holes in backing files being implemented.

    Recent versions of QEMU implement the client side of the protocol, while atthe same time also being able to export local resources through NBD. Thissituation makes it possible for NBD to be used as a protocol for sharedstorage, backup, or mirroring of resources to other systems for livemigration.

    We will quickly cover the history of the protocol, describing some of thefeatures that were added over the years; make a short comparison againstsimilar protocols such as iSCSI and AoE and why NBD is relevant in thatcontext; and then move on to newer features that were added to the protocol atthe request of the QEMU developers.

    In oVirt datacenter virtualization environments, a manager directs hosts toinitiate operations to shared storage. These operations create or removevolumes, copy data between volumes, create or merge snapshots, and variousother actions related to virtual machine storage. For efficiency and balancethese operations should be distributed across multiple hosts and run inparallel when possible. Maintaining reliability under real world conditionsrequires careful management and resilient algorithms. This talk will introducesome of the problems that can arise including: dropped communications,scheduling conflicts, and host or storage array failure. Next, a solution tothese problems using shared storage locking, atomic operations, volumegenerations, and forensic analysis of the storage will be presented. Throughstep by step examples, the audience will understand how the proposed solutioncan solve all of the outlined problems.

    Lago is an ad-hoc virtual framework which helps you build virtualizedenvironments on your server or laptop for various use cases. It creates andorchestrates virtual machines that can be used to run test suites and allow adeveloper to quickly test his code change on non-trivial flows such as livemigration even before starting the CI process. In this session, we will walkthrough the usage of Lago in the oVirt project and how it can be extended toassist virtualization developers.

    Virtualization software became a vital part of the IT infrastructure of mostcompanies nowadays. Making sure that the software works as expected in "realworld" tasks is hard, mainly because virtualization environments are usuallyhard to reproduce automatically. Lago is an ad-hoc virtual framework whichhelps you build virtualized datacenter on your server or laptop to run testsuites. Being a framework, it can be extended to implement any requiredworkflows needed by the tested software.

    We will discuss how Lago works with KVM and Libvirt to create a testenvironment, how it can be extended to help with automated system tests ofvirtualization products and how it is currently used by oVirt project to runautomated system tests and help developers testing their patches duringdevelopment phase. We will also review and compare Lago with tools likeVagrant, when applied to the virtualization development workflow.

    Xen is a hypervisor using a microkernel design that allows running multipleconcurrent operating systems on the same hardware. One of the key features ofXen is that it is OS agnostic, meaning that any OS (with proper support) canbe used as a host. Xen has a long history going back to the 90s when it wasdesigned and the early 2000s when it was released. As a consequence of this,many of the assumptions and virtualization techniques backed into it are nowsuperseeded by new hardware features, that make virtualization moretransparent from an OS point of view.

    This talk provides an overview on the different kind of guests supported byXen and how these new hardware features are used in order to improve andevolve them. It also describes the design and implementation of a new guesttype, called PVHv2, and how it can be used as a control domain (Dom0).

    Live patching -- the process of updating software while it is running -- hasbecome a popular topic of late, with several companies offering servicesproviding live patching for Linux culminating with an implementation beingcontributed to Linux. While Xen supports live migration of VMs which mitigatesthe need for live patching, there are still some reasons why live patching isuseful. For example, to minimize downtime, when running applications with lowlatency requirements, and when using PCI passthrough.

    This talk reviews the state of live patching for Xen. A live patchingimplementation has recently been contributed to Xen so we will look at thedesign and implementation in detail, noting how and why it differs from livepatching for Linux. We will look at some of the ways that live patches can becreated and the pitfalls to watch out for when doing so. There will also be astatus report of ongoing and future work for live patching for Xen. Finally,the talk will show a demo of live patching in action by building a live patchfor a known security issue and applying it to a vulnerable system.

    Xen LivePatch is a new tech preview feature in Xen 4.7 for live patching thehypervisor. It is the result of collaboration between several members in thecommunity guided by the existing live patching efforts for Linux. We will talkabout this and how Xen's requirements differ from Linux.

    The core idea of Xen LivePatch is to insert a "trampoline" in each buggyfunction with a jump to a replacement function. This is simple in principle,but there are a number of complexities which make it interesting to look at.

    Live patches can be built by hand, by compiling the replacement functions in aseparate source file. This is a manual process and can also be unreliable dueto the nature of compiler optimizations. So we repurposed kpatch's live patchcreation tool for Xen. This computes a binary difference of the outputbinaries before and after a source patch is applied. This simplifies theprocess of creating live patches and overcomes issues with compileroptimizations but is still not without difficulties. We look at the process ofcreating live patches and why it is hard.

    The introduction of non-volatile memory changes how applications, databases,and virtual machines will work in the future. NVDIMM is not simply a fasterblock device. Programs can avoid block I/O entirely and use byte-addressableNVDIMM to benefit from the performance characteristics of RAM. This requiresnew storage APIs that applications must use instead of traditional block I/O.

    These new programs run successfully inside KVM virtual machines thanks to thevNVDIMM support already available in QEMU. Virtualization offers additionaloptions for managing and using NVDIMM beyond what is available on bare metal.

    This talk covers the NVDIMM programming model and how KVM virtual machines canuse NVDIMM for faster I/O, reduced memory footprint, and faster boot times.

    Xiao Guangrong recently gave a talk at KVM Forum covering the ACPI andhardware interface for NVDIMM under KVM. I want to follow that up with a talkfor a wider audience of developers and system administrators who care moreabout the use of NVDIMM than its implementation.

    This talk covers recent work on NVDIMM in QEMU and focuses on how applicationscan take advantage of this new class of storage device. It is suitable for anaudience interested in storage or virtualization. Most of the concepts carryover to other hypervisors besides KVM.

    The workloads and scenarios for virtual machines grow more complex every year.So do the interactions, availability, and performance requirements. All thatrequires the administrators to carefully plan where to start the VMs thatdepend on each other and/or specific hosts.

    This talk will present the concepts that allow the administrator to expressthe rules for affinity between virtual machines and between virtual machinesand hosts to form complex relationships that will cover for example:

      * licensing rules - limiting group of VMs to only use certain hosts  * overhead - web + database VMs running together  * performance - eg. storage VMs running on hosts with better IO performance  * failover recovery - VMs returning to “their” hosts  * reservation - There is place for only one of us!

    oVirt is an open source project for managing virtual data centers that willnow help the administrator with exactly the above tasks. We have introducedthe virtual machine affinity feature in the past and a huge improvement inthat area is coming right now.

    And the best part is that all this works in a fully dynamic environment withautomatic conflict resolution and no manual management of host pinning rules,saving the administrator his precious time.

Overtime it has evolved multiple interfaces to interact with the outside world,and multiple internal APIs and abstractions to model and keep track of data.The talk will be a review of some of the challenges and trade-offs involved inmaking those abstractions work together.

    Over time, QEMU has evolved multiple interfaces to interact with the outsideworld (command-line interface, configuration files, its monitor protocol), andmultiple internal APIs and abstractions to model and keep track of data(including configuration, device hierarchy, device state, etc).

    Understanding the goals and limitations of each of those abstractions andfinding their way through the long list of acronyms (qdev, QOM, QAPI, QMP,VMState, QemuOpts, QObject, etc) can be intimidating to developers notfamiliar to QEMU. Sometimes each of them have conflicting world views,different goals and constraints, and interaction between them generateinteresting challenges to developers working on QEMU. The talk will be areview of some of the challenges and trade-offs involved in making thoseabstractions work together.

    First we will briefly look into what a typical container and a typical VM is.Then we will look into the details on how resource and device limitations areenforced on VMs. In our research we used oVirt, so comparing its host sidestack (VDSM/libvirt/QEMU/systemd) to Kubernetes container host side stack(kubelet/docker/rkt/systemd/cni). At the end we will have a betterunderstanding of the differences and overlaps, and can therefore consider howto manage Pet-VMs and containers in the same cluster, managed by kubernetes.

    In a Cloud Native infrastructure, component failure is normal and expected.The loss of a single node or a dozen hard drives is automatically handled bythe systems running a datacenter, removing the need to page someone at 4am.This calls for an alerting system that understands service availability at aglobal scope, yet is still able to give detailed reports if and when there isa service-impacting incident. Prometheus achieves this by defining alertingconditions directly on time series data. The resulting alerts are grouped andaggregated into comprehensive and meaningful notifications. Fabian will walkthrough the philosophy of time series based alerting, the Prometheusarchitecture behind it, and how practical anomaly detection can beimplemented.

    Prometheus is an open source monitoring tool - unlike traditional tools likeNagios, Prometheus implements a white-box monitoring approach: Applicationsactively provide metrics, these metrics are stored in a time-series database,the time-series data is used as a source for generating alerts. Prometheuscomes with a powerful query language allowing for statistical evaluation ofmetrics. Many modern infrastructure components have Prometheus metrics built-in, like Docker's cAdvisor, Kubernetes, or Konsul. Prometheus' servicediscovery mechanisms make monitoring these components very easy.

    The OMD Labs Edition is a collection of proven monitoring tools like Nagios orIcinga together with newcomers like InfluxDB and Grafana to provide a best-practice monitoring platform with advanced features like multi-tenancy. OMDLabs Edition bundles exclusively open-source tools and is itself developedopen-source.

    By adding Prometheus to its stack, OMD Labs Edition is also ready for cloud-native applications. As such it eases the integration of traditionalmonitoring with the needs of dynamic cloud monitoring.

    This talk gives an introduction on how to integrate Kubernetes monitoringusing Prometheus into the OMD Labs Edition.

    Transaction tracing is typically thought of something that only developers dowhen they need to troubleshoot a piece of their software. And lately, it’salso been used for tracing microservice-based transactions too.

    These are really useful capabilities, but what if you could profileeverything? Yes everything - software functions, microservice calls, fileaccess, network requests, even bash scripts. How would this change your viewon your systems? How would this enable you to better understand what yoursoftware is actually doing?

    In this talk I’ll show you how to trace everything using open source sysdig.We’ll cover: \- How to trace everything from a method in your software, aservice call, a network request, a shell command execution, a script, and more\- How to report on your traces to make the most sense of the data \- Usereal-world examples of tracing that show its benefits

    Come and hack on Valgrind together. Open discussion about small (or big) ideasto improve or change Valgrind.

    Valgrind developers and users are encouraged to participate either bysubmitting ideas/suggestions or by joining the discussion. And of course bykindly (or bitterly) complain about bugs you find important that are _still__Not_ _YET_ solved for _that_ many years!?@!!!

    Afterwards we will sit together and try to fix or implement some of the thingsdiscussed.

    Discuss any kind of possible improvement (technical or functional) toValgrind.

    If you want to put something on the agenda please send a small description(one or two paragraphs) to the the moderator Mark Wielaard[mjw@redhat.com](mailto:mjw@redhat.com) with in the subject: "FOSDEM devroomdiscuss: ..." If you want to discuss a somewhat larger topic please do feelfree to send two or three slides in advance.

    Mark will collect ideas/suggestions/... and present these and coordinate thediscussion (and keep track of the time, so every idea will be discussed).

    Some discussion topic ideas:

      * Release/bugfixing strategy/policy.  * Can we move to git yet?  * Valgrind and transactional memory.  * Making Valgrind really multi-threaded, parallelising Memcheck, parallelising the rest of the framework, and tools.  * Instant leak detector. Modify memcheck to report the last leaked pointer to a block. Integrate "omega" as a memcheck option or omega as a separate tool. http://www.brainmurders.eclipse.co.uk/omega.html  * Make Callgrind work sanely on ARM (and PPC). The Callgrind algorithm to track call and return is to be improved to work properly on these platforms. Is there a way to make this better? E.g. by having a fast way working in most cases, and rely on unwind info in the difficult cases. Can we detect at instrumentation time that an instruction is a difficult case?  * Packaging valgrind for distros, handling patches, suppressions, etc.  * 32-bit x86 vs modern instruction sets (avx, etc.)  * VEX is in theory cross-architecture. What would it take to make valgrind cross-arch? How about starting with i686 on x86_64?  * Which CPUID is it anyway? Valgrind isn't completely consistent in handling host CPU capabilities vs VEX emulation capabilities. What can we do to improve that? Make it user tunable?  * <YOUR SUGGESTION HERE!>

    And now is the time on Sprockets when we hack!

    Valgrind and its different tools are providing a rich set of functionality totrack memory problems such as dangling pointers, memory leaks, raceconditions, etc.

    In this talk, we will describe some old and new features that help tounderstand what happens in your application. Among others, we will give a demoand/or discuss:

      * how to use valgrind with your application specific memory pool

      * how to (interactively) ask Valgrind to describe a piece of memory

      * some heuristics used by Valgrind to reduce the number of 'possibly lost' leaks with C++ code

      * ...

    We will discuss more in detail the concept of execution trees, which will beavailable in the next Valgrind release. An execution tree associates stacktraces of your program with some data. Execution trees allow Memcheck andHelgrind to provide a memory profile of your application. We will show howsuch an execution tree memory profile can be visualised using tools such asMassif visualiser or kcachegrind.

    Memcheck is probably the most heavily used tool in the Valgrind suite,checking for invalid addresses, undefined values and memory leaks. In thistalk I'll look back at the history of the tool, then I'll look forwards atsome of the challenges it faces as the hardware and software ecosystemcontinue to evolve around it. I'll talk a bit about some of the effects ofMemcheck on the C++ ecosystem and how it fits into the big picture of makingyour big C++ app crash-free and reliable.

    This talk is aimed at Valgrind (Memcheck!) users and developers. It should beaccessible to C/C++/Fortran developers who have used the tool or are thinkingof doing so.

    gcc/glibc support fortification of some functions by defining _FORTIFY_SOURCE. This inserts some compile and runtime buffer overflow checks forselected glibc functions. These checks have no or very little runtime overheadand work on the object level (the compiler provides/proofs the size of theobject buffer size). valgrind memcheck provides similar memory buffer overflowchecks. These checks don't need any compiler help (you won't have to rebuildyour code). But they have a much higher runtime overhead. They also work on adifferent level. valgrind memcheck doesn't know anything about the objects theuser is manipulation but has knowledge of all memory blocks allocated. Letsexplore how these different mechanisms work and how we can make them workbetter together.

    SPARC is an instruction set architecture (ISA) originally developed by SunMicrosystems since 1980's. Today's largest enterprise servers run on sparc,leveraging several terabytes of memory and several hundreds of CPUs. This talkwill briefly introduce key concepts of sparcv9 ISA and the big picture wheresupport of a new architecture fits into Valgrind architecture. Someinteresting problems during the port will be discussed together with solutionsand still-to-be-solved issues. Finally a live demo will conclude the talk. Thetalk assumes basic knowledge of Valgrind, interaction among Valgrindsubsystems, basic assembly and VEX IR notation. It is targeted to allinterested in sparcv9 ISA and running Valgrind on sparc.

    Making Valgrind faster is a never ending challenge. In this talk, we willdescribe 2 optimisations in Valgrind.

    A first optimisation is a speedup of Helgrind (a race detection tool). A verysimple observation has led to an optimisation in the way helgrind capturesstack traces for its 'full recording' of where a piece of memory was modified.This optimisation gives a typical speed up of 25%. We will describe the issuesencountered during the implementation and discuss the reasons why thisoptimisation is not (yet?) committed in the Valgrind sources.

    The second optimisation is the implementation of the execution tree concept :this generalises the way Massif (a heap profiler) records the memory usage ofa program. We will show how a (maybe counter-intuitive) representation of atree using a hash table of flat stack traces has doubled the speed of Massiffor some workloads.

    This talk is aimed at Valgrind developers and any application developerinterested in data structures and algorithm optimisations.

    The angr binary analysis platform (http://angr.io) uses libVEX as the base ofits analysis engine. In this talk, we discuss the things about VEX that makeit attractive for static analysis and symbolic execution, its pitfalls, andways that it can be improved, including the changes we have made in our forkof libVEX.

    Agenda

      * The goals of static analysis and symbolic execution on binary code  * Brief overview of competing analysis IRs  * Design of angr structured around libVEX     * PyVEX, FFI wrapper of libVEX objects into python    * simuvex, symbolic implementation of most VEX operations, ccalls, and dirty calls  * Pitfalls we've encountered     * VEX is not truly SSA    * libVEX is not designed for fault tolerance    * libVEX's multiarch support is a little shoddy    * Licensing concerns  * Our patches to libVEX     * The only real thing stopping us from submitting our patches upstream is manpower  * The possibility of a simplified python interface for writing lifters  * angr     * symbolic execution    * static analyses       * control-flow recovery      * binary rewriting      * type inference (sort of)      * value-set analysis

    VEX is the JIT at the core of Valgrind. It unpicks blocks of machine code,hands them off to the tool for instrumentation, recompiles the result, andlinks the instrumented version into the running image. By using a targetindependent intermediate representation, it insulates tools from thecomplexity of the underlying instruction sets.

    Back in 2003, when the framework was designed, I never dreamt that it wouldend up supporting X86, ARM, POWER, MIPS, S390 and TILEGX in both 32- and64-bit variants. From that perspective VEX has been amazingly successful. Butthe framework is now showing its age. Recent instruction set features(transactional memory, LoadLinked/StoreConditional, wide vectors) have provendifficult to implement. It supports precise memory exceptions only poorly. Andperhaps worst, its simplistic compilation pipeline causes it to generate codethat is uncompetitive compared to other frameworks, particularly DynamoRIO andPIN.

    In this talk I'll outline VEX's structure, then talk about these problems andwhat can be done about them. And I'd be particularly interested to hearopinions on how much effort, and for which problem areas, should be investedin upgrading it.

    For the audience, some background in compiler internals and assembly codeprogramming would be helpful, but is not essential.

But participating in these projects is more than just tossing insome candidates for a small sub-project you've got going on and letting themdo all the work. To get a real benefit for your interns and your project,positive, active mentoring must take place.

    Mentoring is a complex exercise for both the mentors and the mentored. It'snot "management"--it's guidance. It's setting the mentored on a path that willnot only solve a specific problem but share information and knowledge gainedby the mentor over years of experience.

    Complex Adaptive Systems are everywhere in nature, but they can also guide usto build large contributor groups. Learn how to apply their 6 key strategiesto create a global self-sustaining community, which were successfully used inevolution of the Google Developer Groups to a global movement.

    Ever wondered if your project has a potential to engage a large, globalcontributor community? Well, likely it has. You just have to follow thenature! So consider ant nests, Amazon rainforests or financial markets… whatdo have these in common with global developer communities? All share the samekey principles enabling their relatively limited individual members tointeract, create emergent projects and co-evolve these ecosystems to massivescale in a distributed, boss-less way. When building developer communities, wecan learn a lot from natural systems about how to create a similar self-sustained ecosystem of people, contributing to a larger cause. The keyprinciples have been well described by the complex adaptive theory, but let’sbe very practical today. On the example of building [Google DeveloperGroups](https://developers.google.com/groups/) from few contributors 9 yearsago to today’s massive global volunteer movement running one meetup eventapproximately every hour, we’ll show how _you_ can apply the very sameprinciples to _your_ community or volunteer based project and grow yourecosystem big, yet still actionable.

    We are all a product of our experiences. Different communities around theworld have different core assumptions about behaviour, how decisions are made,the role of the individual in a group, and more. What makes up culture, andcan we have better community experiences by understanding it?

    We are all a product of our experiences. Different communities around theworld have different core assumptions about behaviour, how decisions are made,the role of the individual in a group, and more. Sociologist Geert Hofstededefined six dimensions of culture, covering values, the relationship of theindividual to a group, respect for hierarchy, and attitude to change. Inaddition to these, there is a wide variation in communication styles relatedto the use of physical gestures, attitudes to silence, the need for context.

    By understanding what makes up culture, you will have tools to question yourown cultural assumptions, increase your empathy for other participants fromdifferent cultures, and avoid misunderstandings as soon as they occur. Can wehave better community experiences by understanding the culture participantsare coming from? Can we give tools to current community members to be moreculturally sensitive and welcoming? And can we also give better advice topeople joining the project for the first time, which meets them where theyare, rather than expecting them to fit in with the community culture on dayone?

    This talk will discuss about the methods FOSS communities can adopt to improvecontributor retention rates. I will explain different community-orientedmetrics we use at Fedora to understand community health like contributorengagement metrics, contributor onboarding and retention rates etc. I willthen share some insights derived from finding common patterns in contributionactivity of long-term active contributors i.e. Are long-term activecontributors involved in many different areas of their projects? What are somegood measures to predict longetivity of contributors ? What is the magicelement X that makes people stay ? I will talk on how a community can applythe insights generated from these metrics to devise methods/guidelines toimprove contributor retention rates and how an individual interested incontributing can ensure their prolonged interest in the FOSSproject/organization.

    In the end, I will also share my experience as a newcomer and contributor toCommunity Operations team of Fedora and have a brief QnA session about thesteps FOSS communities apart from Fedora are taking to improve theircontributor retention rates.

    We talk about accessibility a lot when we write code, whether that is writinggood documentation, comment blocks or creating a good user experience. When itcomes to our user groups and events, accessibility is not usually on theforefront of our minds.

    At WordCamp London, the organising team made accessibility the key goal of theevent. We wanted to see how far we could push being accessible and how mucheffort it would take.

    This talk is for any event organisers, community evangelists or managers whoare looking for solutions to help grow their communities. Wong will be talkingabout the challenges of organising an accessible event, including how theydegendered content, added child care facilities and helped the hard ofhearing.

    How do we decide when a discussion is complete? How do we know we've heardfrom enough people, or that the topic isn't dead yet? Deciding how to takedecisions in a community is hard - in this talk, I'd like to ways to handleit.

    Figuring out when to close a discussion is really hard - and more so if allthe participants are only using forums/mailinglists/chat rather than beingface-to-face. Knowing that you've heard from the right people, trying toensure quiet voices are heard, and making sure you're not cutting thediscussion too early (or too late) really matters. In this "talk" I'd like tobring some examples of such discussions from our community (e.g. things whichcaused conflict, things which caused communications blocks, and so on), talkabout how we handled them, and discuss ways in which we could improve -hopefully to the benefit of everyone present.

    Your project's code base is rock solid, you are rolling releases early andoften, your test suite is comprehensive and running regularly, your code iswell performing without any glitches. Everything is in place that defines asuccessful open source project - or isn't it?

    This talk tries to highlight some of the key questions software developerswill quickly be faced with when dealing with open source: In addition tocoding skills, topics like people management, naming, trademark enforcement,licensing, patents, pr and more become topics to deal with.

    After years of using open source projects, running my own projects, foundingmeetups and conferences, watching others thrive or fail I believe that codingskills alone aren't sufficient to turn a "private play ground code base" intoan open source project that other's can rely on.

    Inspired by 140 characters of truth published here:https://twitter.com/janl/status/... the talk will focus on what topics thatare usually not taught as part of programming courses will cross your way whendealing with open source - either as a user or as a contributor:

      * People: Is the project willing and able to attract more contributors? Is it able to survive if the leader looses interest or time to continue contributing? How does the project deal with requests coming from the user base? How easy is it for users to get their issues fixed?

      * Trademarks: Why should you care about trademarks from the beginning? How do you deal with others infringing on your trademarks?

      * Copyright: Why should you care, exactly which license you choose?

      * PR: While writing release notes is common practice and composing changelogs is pretty easy, the resulting documents are hard to grok for editors and won't get you on the front page of any magazine. Nor will they help you get visibility on common social media systems that might be key in informing your users about recent releases.

    While being excellent at all topics isn't vital from the start, answers togovernance questions decide what a project looks like a few years from it'sstart.

    We will present some typical community management worries about communityhealth, productivity and visibility and how some open source tools could beused to face them. Open source development transparency allows community tobehave as data scientists and extract valuable information.

    During last years, we have seen the growth of an specific position in manycompanies and OSS foundations. You might have seen them as “communitymanagers”, “developer advocates”, “developer relations”, etc. All of themshare some goals / responsibilities in common with their communities: health,productivity and visibility. How to achieve them?

    It has been said that “without data, you are another person with an opinion”,and management shouldn’t rely in opinions but facts. This path increasestransparency, trust and reduces conflicts, since usually “numbers speak louderthan opinions”.

    If we look around in our daily live many of us are already working with toolsfor similar goals in different areas of life. We can wear heart rate monitors,check our activity in github or jira and play with zillions of marketingcampaigning tools.

    In OSS communities people “contribute” for a goal. So, we should start bylooking at where people are contributing, and here starts the “communitymanager nightmare”. People contribute in a lot of places: github, gerrit,jira, mailing lists, slack, meetup, etc. It seems obvious which data sourceswe have and since most of us are technical people, we might build our owntools for tracking them. Have you already gone through that path? Some of ourbest friends have gone, wasting 80% taking data instead of taking decisions.Lots of places to look at, mainly silos of data you need to massage to getinformation out of them, and limited amount of time understand and manage yourproject.

    During this talk, we will present some community managers typical questionsand how tools OSS, like for example GrimoireLab, could be used to answer them,allowing the community to behave as data scientists extracting valuableinformation from within and be a data driven community.

    These kind of tools represent a new ecosystem for “Open DevelopmentAnalytics”, where communities can (and probably should) rely on open tools toensure transparency on such important process like “measuring the community”.

    Building safer spaces for everyone can be hard if the wrong questions areanswered. I will show how, by working on the root causes of the issues weface, we can be successful in creating better spaces for everyone toparticipate.

    We often think about our Free and Libre Open Source communities as being builton egalitarian principles of meritocracy and do-ocracy: anyone with the willand the skills can be involved and have their work recognized.

    However, without awareness of how power is distributed and how socialinteractions take place, those communities are very likely to reproducepatterns leading to excluding people. Even when we are aware of the need andbenefits of building better and safer spaces for everyone, implementations arenot that easy and one might despair of not being successful.

    In this talk, I will present some key principles learned from my experience toshow how, by working on the root causes of the issues we face, we can besuccessful in creating better spaces for everyone to participate: what powerpatterns are involved in our social interactions; what can go wrong with thepolitics of “Inclusion and Diversity”; how we can concretely improve ourpersonal and collective practices for a better good.

    The talk will explain how to analyze software development repositories ofcommon use in the free software community with [GrimoireLabtools][http://grimoirelab.github.io], a toolset for software developmentanalytics writting in Python. It will start by explaining how to retrieve datafrom git, Bugzilla, GitHub, mailing lists, StackOverflow, Gerrit, and manyother repositories by, and organizing it in a database. The talk will laterexplain how this database can be exploited with several components of thetoolset, for different purposes. In this context, special attention will begiven to how to extract useful information from it using Python/Pandas andiPython/Jupyter Notebooks; and how to use ElasticSearch/Kibana to deployactionable dashboards that show data in all its glory.

    Many free / open source software (FOSS) projects feature an open developmentmodel, with public software development repositories which anyone can browse.These repositories are normally used to find specific information, such acertain commit or a particular bug report. But they can also be mined toextract all relevant data, so that it can be analyzed later to learn about anyspecific or general aspect of the project. This talk will explain theGrimoireLab method for doing that, which is based on organizing all thatinformation in a database, which can be later analyzed. This approach allowsfor minimal impact on the project infrastructure, since data is retrieved onlyonce, even if it later analyzed many times. It allows as well for efficiencyand comfort when mining data for an analysis, since the results are readilyavailable, databases can be shared and replicated at will, and queried themwith any kind of tools is easy.

    The tools that retrieve information from the repositories are grouped in theGrimoireLab toolset. It includes mature, widely tested programs capable ofextracting information from most repositories used by FOSS projects of anyscale. Many of them are agnostic with respect to the database used, althoughcurrently ElasticSearch is the best supported.

    The produced databases can be exploited in several ways, of which two will beexplained during the talk: using Python/Pandas to produce iPython/JupyterNotebooks which analyze some aspect of the project; and using Python to feed aElasticSearch cluster, with a Kibana front-end for visualizing in a flexible,powerful dashboard.

    All these approaches can be used to understand general aspects of the project,such as how efficient are the code review or bug fixing processes, how diverseare contributions to the git repository, or how conversations in mailing listsor StackOverflow are shaped. But they can be used as well to drill down, andanalyze the contributions by a certain developer, or the longer code reviewprocesses, or the contents of the most lively email and QA threads.

    The talk will explain the whole process from data retrieval to visualization,and will show some specific cases of real world use, such as the dashboardsproduced for Eclipse, OPNFV, MediaWiki and many others. Some of the contentsof the talk are described in detail in the online book GrimoireLab Training.

    Video playback for embedded devices such as infotainment systems and mediacenters demands hardware accelerators to achieve reasonable performance.Unfortunately, vendors provide the drivers for the accelerators only as binaryblobs. We demonstrate how we built a video playback system that uses hardwareacceleration on i.MX6 by using solely open source software includingGstreamer, Qt QML, the etnaviv GPU driver, and the coda video decoder driver.

    While hardware accelerators are necessary to provide reasonable performancefor video playback on embedded devices, the drivers that are provided asbinary blobs by hardware vendors cause a lot of problems. They are linked tospecific versions of the Linux kernel, may contain security and performanceissues, and are pretty much impossible to debug by developers trying to builda system based on these drivers.

    We built an i.MX6 based embedded system that simultaneously decodes anddisplays four videos. Our system solely uses open source drivers to controlthe available hardware accelerators.

    The GUI consists of a Qt application based on QML. Using Qt and QML allows usto use OpenGL for compositing the user interface. OpenGL is backed by the opensource etnativ GPU driver and the Vivante GPU.

    The Qt application receives the video streams from a Gstreamer pipeline (usingplaybin). The Gstreamer pipeline contains a v4l2 decoder element, which usesthe coda v4l2 driver for the CODA 960 video encoder and decoder IP core (VPUin the Freescale/NXP Reference Manual), and a sink element to make the framesavailable to the Qt application.

    The entire pipeline including the Gstreamer to Qt handover uses dma_bufs toavoid copies in software.

    This example shows how to use open source drivers to ease the development ofvideo and graphics applications on embedded systems.

    Recent DDoS attacks powered by embedded devices have finally discredited theold excuse that security is not important: security support (and thus softwareupdates) is suddenly a required feature.

    Often, physical access to these devices is limited and there is noadministrator who can fix issues manually. Thus, performing updates is anoperation with a critical design goal: Never brick the device!

    This talk gives an overview of the surprisingly complex requirements andcommon pitfalls for a generic update mechanism by comparing several existingapproaches. Also, our reasons for implementing (yet another) tool and thereasoning behind the design choices are explained.

    Using RAUC and other open source update tools as examples, requirements,limitations and possible pitfalls in the process of designing and implementinga redundancy and update infrastructure will be presented. You will also get abrief overview over RAUCs design and abstraction of the underlying system thatallows to manage both simple asymmetric setups consisting of a full system andan initramfs-based recovery system as well as complex setups with multipleroot filesystems, application and data storage partitions.

      * How to make updates atomic?  * How to manage both simple and complex redundancy concepts?  * How to allow secure and trusted updates?  * How to schedule updates to a large number of devices?

    Google’s chromebooks and routers use off the shelf Microcontrollers (MCU) todo power sequencing, fan control, PWM and other hardware control tasks onetypically encounters in embedded systems. Interestingly enough the firmware isavailable under (3 clause) BSD license and thus open for hacking, abusing andmodifying to your needs.

    We’ll look at a bunch of MCU options and eval boards to get started with,their availability and pricing in low quantities as well as ways to hook themup to your embedded platform. Moreover we’ll look at hardware levelrequirements your SoC / board will have to provide in order to make it allwork.

    We’ll cover existing driver / software support in upstream Linux and U-Boot,as well as parts that are or were missing.

    Typical tasks of an embedded controller for a chromebook or random otherdevices like mine - which is everything but a laptop - will be discussed.Topics covered will include boot selection, firmware upgrades, watchdog timersand others.

    Finally I’ll share my experiences building a real world Zynq based systemusing chromium-ec on an STM32 MCU and my experiences adapting the software tomy needs and interacting with the community. Examples include replacing thecoreboot bootflow with U-Boot, creating device drivers for things like buttonsand issues encountered in making things work.

    Security reasons and market demands dictate that software in a connectedembedded Linux device should be updated regularly. Update on a package basisthat is used by PC Linux distributions can be a security threat by itself onembedded devices. On the other hand, full fylesystem upgrade that is common inembedded field can be too wasteful for systems constrained in network bandwithand disk space. OSTree is a tool that allows for upgrades that are bothincremental and atomic and as such perfectly fits the needs of embedded world.

    Software updating is an essential feature for a connected embedded Linuxdevice, even if it is not required by end users of the device, since responceto newly discovered vulnerabilities in critical Linux software should be asfast as possible. One approach that is widely used in Linux world is using apackage manager that will download a package and take care of all thedependencies. Unfortunately, some dependencies and/or conflicts with otherpackages can not be noticed by repository mantainers. On a PC it would justlead to the necessity to revert the package back to the working version, buton an embedded device with no human operator it is not possible.Theoretically, number of system configurations is an exponent of number ofpackages one can install, which means that it is practically impossible tomake sure that no combination will result in a broken system. In embeddedworld it is more common to update whole file system image atomically. Thus wecan test system configuration before we distribute it to the devices. To allowfor atomic switching between file tree versions, dual disk partitioning schemeis used: while Linux is running on a root file system stored in one partition,updates are written to another. When the whole new file system image isdownloaded, Linux can switch atomically to it. The main drawback of thisapproach is that you actually have to download the whole file tree (which canbe 100-800MB large in modern devices) for every update. You also can use onlyhalf of your available disk space at once.

    OSTree was developed by GNOME team for the GNOME Continuous project and wasnot initialy intended to be used in embedded Linux. It stores all the data ina git-like object repository, but unlike git it is designed to store binarydata and can deploy data as hardlinks to the objects in the repository, thussaving significant amount of disk space. Like git it allows to incrementallytransfer data between repositories, thus making distribution of softwareupdates possible. OSTree repository contains roughly three kinds of objects:commit, directory and file object. Every commit points to a directory tree andrepresents a version of file system tree. Commits can then be deployed to adedicated area and the system can switch to a deployed file tree much the sameway it would switch to another partition in dual-partition scheme. Sincedeploying files just creates hard links to the file objects in the repository,there is no data duplication.

    These benefits come at a price: since deployed files are just hardlinks toobjects in a repository, they can't be changed, as it would corrupt therepository and other deployed file systems. Therefore, a clear separationshould be mantained between read-only data, such as executables and resourcesand writable data, such as temporary files, logs, configuration stored in/etc. These requirements are not too restrictive, for most use-cases it willjust involve putting data in correct directories. An image class thatthansforms an OSTree-ignorant file tree to appropriate form and BSP packagesfor some popular platforms (Raspberry Pi, Porter board, QEMU; minnowboardcoming soon) were integrated into Yocto build process and are now available asa separate Yocto layer on Github [https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater]. It allows you to create OSTree-enabled image and a commit in yourOSTree repository as a part of your normal build process (simply 'bitbakeyour_image').

    There is no de facto secured embedded Linux distro while the requirement isbecoming more and more critical with raise of IoT in Industrial domains. Whenlooking under the hood of the Yocto built AGL project, it is obvious that itcan fit 95% of the most common requirements as a Secured Embedded Linux. Wewill look how non Automotive industries can easily reuse the AGL code andtools to build their own industrial product and why it's a safer bet than tobuild it internally.

    Industrial IoT cannot be successful without a serious improvement of thesecurity coverage. Unfortunately there is as today, no of-the-shelves offerand the skills required to create such solution, are at best rare, more oftenout of reach. AGL as created a customizable embedded Linux distro which isnicely designed for reuse in many domains outside of Automotive. During thepresentation we will see how to: \- start your development with boards readilyavailable on the Net, \- change the BSP and add peripherial using Yocto layersor project like MRAA, \- integrate a secure boot in your platform, \- add yourmiddleware and your application without breaking the maintained Core OS \-develop a UI on the integrated screen and/or an HTML remote brower \- updatethe core OS and your add-ons. \- get support and influence the project.

    If you're making electronic music in 2017, you're likely to have seen or usedone of Native Instrument's "Maschine", "Maschine Jam", Novation's "Circuit",or Ableton's "Push"... These pad-based devices allow musicians to triggersamples, and create rhythms intuitively by the means of a "step sequencer".The said step sequencer is implemented in the box and stays in it...

    Thanks to "mido" and "portmidi" libraries, I designed a lightweight opensource software sequencer (without a GUI), exposing abstractions for pythonprogrammers to use their existing MIDI-enabled hardware. My MiniNova, LaunchControl and Quneo devices were hacked this way to create new functionalitytogether.

    The talk starts with a quick explanation of MIDI and step sequencing, thendescribes the benefits and challenges of using Python in this context, as wellas the choice of gevent against other async frameworks. It ends of course witha live demo!

    Selinon is a project that is based on popular Python project Celery. Celery isa distributed task queue that offers one to run tasks. Selinon gives one apower to define flows and dependencies in flows, schedule tasks based onresults of workers, success or any external events, handle errors, trace flowstate and actions in a distributed environment. Its main goal is to split tasklogic (code) and persistence logic from data and time dependencies betweentasks in flows that are stated in simple YAML configuration files.

    Selinon is an advanced flow management above Celery project (an asynchronousdistributed task queue) written in Python3, that allows you to dynamicallyschedule tasks based on results of previous tasks, group tasks to flows,schedule flows from other flows, store results of tasks in your storages anddatabases transparently, validate results against defined JSON schemas, trackflow progress via the build-in tracing mechanism, complex per-task or per-flowfailure handling with fallback tasks or fallback flows and run the wholesystem in a distributed environments orchestrated by OpenShift or Kubernetes.

    When things go wrong in production, it can be necessary to troubleshootproblems where they occur, instead of in a development environment. In thosesituations having a working knowledge of GDB, GDB Python Extensions, andstrace is very helpful. You will see some simple techniques to get insightinto those situations. This talk outlines several techniques for connecting toan already running, "stuck", or deadlocked Python process using GDB fordebugging.

    During the talk, we will:

      * inspect the current state of threads with  * use and demo the GDB macros for Python  * inspect a locally running process and a core dump collected from a remote machine  * use strace to gather system call information about a process  * discuss the SIGTRAP handler as a proactive way to make rpdb available in production.

    I have had to debug several hard-to-find bugs that were very infrequentdeadlocks using Python. Furthermore it was happening on remote machines Icould not have network access to. This technique was invaluable in thosesituations.

    Serverside applications are more and more likely to need to run in dynamiccloud environments where they can automatically scale as required. Onerightfully popular approach is to run the application as a Docker containerinside a Kubernetes cluster, giving you a lot of operational benefits thanksto the Kubernetes folks.

    For the most part it is rather easy to make your Python application workinside a Docker container. But there are a number of common patterns one canfollow to save time by delegating more things to the runtime environment.Furthermore you can start adding a few simple non-intrusive features to yourapplication which will help improve the application live-cycle in the cluster,ensuring smooth hand-over when migrating the container to different nodes orscaling it up or down.

    This talk will discuss how to write a Python application which will behavewell in this environment, starting with the basics steps you can rely on theruntime for, covering logging and all the way to supporting the service life-cycle, health checking and monitoring in a Kubernetes environment. You willsee that building a cloud-native application is not very hard and somethingyou can gradually introduce.

    Working on optimizations is a task more complex than expected on the firstlook. Any optimization must be measured to make sure that, in practice, itspeeds up the application task. Problem: it is very hard to obtain stablebenchmark results.

    The stability of a benchmark (performance measurement) is essential to be ableto compare two versions of the code and compute the difference (faster orslower?). An unstable benchmark is useless, and is a risk of giving a falseresult when comparing performance which could lead to bad decisions.

    I'm gonna show you the Python project "perf" which helps to launch benchmarks,but also to analyze them: compute the mean and the standard deviation onmultiple runs, render an histogram to visualize the probability curve, comparebetween multiple results, run again a benchmark to collect more samples, etc.

    The use case is to measure small isolated optimizations on CPython and makesure that they don't introduce performance regression in term of performance.

    Introducing Python developers to the world of physical computing and IoT usingPython on the Raspberry Pi.

    There's great fun to be had using the Pi's GPIO pins to connect with the realworld for home automation and IoT projects. Python libraries like GPIO Zero,Picamera and Sense HAT provide a simple interface to GPIO devices, HATs andmore.

    I will demonstrate the possibilities and show the power of Python in thisenvironment.

    The Raspberry Pi Foundation is working to put the power of digital making inthe hands of people all over the world, and is well known for its series ofsmall, cheap single board computers.

    The Raspberry Pi runs a well supported Linux distro based on Debian, whichships with a variety of programming tools and educational software. Python isthe main supported language on the platform, used in many educationalresources, and many Python libraries exist for making the most of the Piplatform with other devices.

    I will cover:

      * Raspberry Pi Foundation mission  * Raspberry Pi hardware specs  * Raspbian desktop  * GPIO pins  * GPIO Zero (Python library)  * Picamera  * Astro Pi (ESA space mission) & Sense HAT  * More HATs  * Pi projects  * Raspberry Pi community
